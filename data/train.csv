1,29857264,"Exercise-Associated Muscle Cramps (EAMC) are a common painful condition of muscle spasms. Despite scientists tried to understand the physiological mechanism that underlies these common phenomena, the etiology is still unclear. From 1900 to nowadays, the scientific world retracted several times the original hypothesis of heat cramps. However, recent literature seems to focus on two potential mechanisms: the dehydration or electrolyte depletion mechanism, and the neuromuscular mechanism. The aim of this review is to examine the recent literature, in terms of physiological mechanisms of EAMC. A comprehensive search was conducted on PubMed and Google Scholar. The following terminology was applied: muscle cramps, neuromuscular hypothesis (or thesis), dehydration hypothesis, Exercise-Associated muscle cramps, nocturnal cramps, muscle spasm, muscle fatigue. From the initial literature of 424 manuscripts, sixty-nine manuscripts were included, analyzed, compared and summarized. Literature analysis indicates that neuromuscular hypothesis may prevails over the initial hypothesis of the dehydration as the trigger event of muscle cramps. New evidence suggests that the action potentials during a muscle cramp are generated in the motoneuron soma, likely accompanied by an imbalance between the rising excitatory drive from the muscle spindles (Ia) and the decreasing inhibitory drive from the Golgi tendon organs. In conclusion, from the latest investigations there seem to be a spinal involvement rather than a peripheral excitation of the motoneurons.","Exercise-Associated Muscle Cramps (EAMC) are a common type of muscle spasm, in which a muscle continually contracts without intention, causing pain. Scientists have tried to explain why these cramps happen, but have not been able to. An idea commonly returned to throughout the years is that EAMCs may be caused by heat. Recently, though, more likely explanations are thought to include dehydration, lack of electrolytes, or issues with the nerves connecting to the muscles. The aim of this review is to look at recent research into how and why EAMCs happen. We searched common online resources for papers. For search terms, we used: muscle cramps, neuromuscular hypothesis (or thesis), dehydration hypothesis, Exercise-Associated muscle cramps, nocturnal cramps, muscle spasm, muscle fatigue. The search returned 424 papers. We read and analyzed 69 of them. From the latest evidence, interactions of nerves with muscles explains muscle cramps better than dehydration. Muscle contraction is normally balanced by special cells in the muscles that sense how stretched or contracted the muscles are. Recent findings suggest malfunctions in these sensor cells result in spinal nerves sending unnecessary signals for the muscles to contract. In summary, the signal causing muscles to contract during a spasm seems to come from the spine rather than the nerve endings within the muscles.",2,C
1,33722257,"Background: Muscle cramp is a painful, involuntary muscle contraction, and that occurs during or following exercise is referred to as exercise-associated muscle cramp (EAMC). The causes of EAMC are likely to be multifactorial, but dehydration and electrolytes deficits are considered to be factors. This study tested the hypothesis that post-exercise muscle cramp susceptibility would be increased with spring water ingestion, but reduced with oral rehydration solution (ORS) ingestion during exercise. Methods: Ten men performed downhill running (DHR) in the heat (35-36 °C) for 40-60 min to reduce 1.5-2% of their body mass in two conditions (spring water vs ORS) in a cross-over design. The body mass was measured at 20 min and every 10 min thereafter during DHR, and 30 min post-DHR. The participants ingested either spring water or ORS for the body mass loss in each period. The two conditions were counter-balanced among the participants and separated by a week. Calf muscle cramp susceptibility was assessed by a threshold frequency (TF) of an electrical train stimulation to induce cramp before, immediately after, 30 and 65 min post-DHR. Blood samples were taken before, immediately after and 65 min after DHR to measure serum sodium, potassium, magnesium and chroride concentrations, hematocrit (Hct), hemoglobin (Hb), and serum osmolarity. Changes in these varaibles over time were compared between conditions by two-way repeated measures of analysis of variance. Results: The average (±SD) baseline TF (25.6 ± 0.7 Hz) was the same between conditions. TF decreased 3.8 ± 2.7 to 4.5 ± 1.7 Hz from the baseline value immediately to 65 min post-DHR for the spring water condition, but increased 6.5 ± 4.9 to 13.6 ± 6.0 Hz in the same time period for the ORS condition (P < 0.05). Hct and Hb did not change significantly (P > 0.05) for both conditions, but osmolarity decreased (P < 0.05) only for the spring water condition. Serum sodium and chloride concentrations decreased (< 2%) at immediately post-DHR for the spring water condition only (P < 0.05). Conclusions: These results suggest that ORS intake during exercise decreased muscle cramp susceptibility. It was concluded that ingesting ORS appeared to be effective for preventing EAMC.","Muscle cramps are unconscious contractions of muscles that are painful. When they happen during or after excercise, they are called Exercise-Associated Muscle Cramps (EAMC). There are probably many causes of EAMC, but dehydration and lack of electrolytes (mineral salts dissolved in the blood) are thought to play roles. This study tested whether drinking a special drink called Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS) while exercising made Exercise-Associated Muscle Cramps less likely than drinking spring water. Ten men ran downhill in hot conditions for 40-60 minutes, drinking either spring water or ORS. Their weights were measured 20 minutes into the exercise, then every 10 minutes, and then 30 minutes after the exercise was completed. After each measurement, the men drank enough of either the spring water or ORS to make up for the weight they lost. We did the experiment twice, a week apart, so that each person tried both drinks. We balanced which order they tried the drinks in.   Muscle cramps were easier to induce in participants who had drunk spring water than in participants who had drunk ORS. Some electrolytes in the blood decreased for participants who were drinking only spring water. The study showed that the drinking ORS (Oral Rehydration Solution) during exercise made muscle cramps less likely.",2,C
1,31696455,"Muscle cramp is a temporary but intense and painful involuntary contraction of skeletal muscle that can occur in many different situations. The causes of, and cures for, the cramps that occur during or soon after exercise remain uncertain, although there is evidence that some cases may be associated with disturbances of water and salt balance, while others appear to involve sustained abnormal spinal reflex activity secondary to fatigue of the affected muscles. Evidence in favour of a role for dyshydration comes largely from medical records obtained in large industrial settings, although it is supported by one large-scale intervention trial and by field trials involving small numbers of athletes. Cramp is notoriously unpredictable, making laboratory studies difficult, but experimental models involving electrical stimulation or intense voluntary contractions of small muscles held in a shortened position can induce cramp in many, although not all, individuals. These studies show that dehydration has no effect on the stimulation frequency required to initiate cramping and confirm a role for spinal pathways, but their relevance to the spontaneous cramps that occur during exercise is questionable. There is a long history of folk remedies for treatment or prevention of cramps; some may reduce the likelihood of some forms of cramping and reduce its intensity and duration, but none are consistently effective. It seems likely that there are different types of cramp that are initiated by different mechanisms; if this is the case, the search for a single strategy for prevention or treatment is unlikely to succeed.","Muscle cramp is a temporary but intense, painful, uncontrollable muscle contraction that can occur for different reasons.

1,30168894,"Muscular cramp is a common symptom in healthy people, especially among the elderly and in young people after vigorous or peak exercise. It is prominent in a number of benign neurological syndromes. It is a particular feature of chronic neurogenic disorders, especially amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. A literature review was undertaken to understand the diverse clinical associations of cramp and its neurophysiological basis, taking into account recent developments in membrane physiology and modulation of motor neuronal excitability. Many aspects of cramping remain incompletely understood and require further study. Current treatment options are correspondingly limited.","Muscle cramps are common in healthy people, especially in the elderly and young people after intense exercise.

1,29763070,"Muscle cramps result in continuous, involuntary, painful, and localized contraction of an entire muscle group, individual single muscle, or select muscle fibers. Generally, the cramp can last from minutes to a few seconds for idiopathic or known causes with healthy subjects or in the presence of diseases. Palpating the muscle area of the cramp will present a knot. Exercise-associated muscle cramps are the most frequent condition requiring medical/therapeutic intervention during sports. The specific etiology is not well understood and possible causes depend on the physiological or pathological situation in which the cramps appear. It is important to note that a painful contraction that is limited to a specific area does not mean that the cause of the cramp is necessarily local. A cramp is almost never a local effect but involves the whole body system, such as somatic and emotional.","Muscle cramps cause constant and unintended contraction of muscles, causing pain. They can occur for individual muscles, groups of muscles, or small parts of muscles. A cramp usually lasts seconds or minutes, regardless of cause and how healthy you are. A knot (hard area) can be felt beneath the skin where the cramp is. Muscle cramps are the most common reason for seeking medical help during sports. We still don't know why muscle cramps happen. Causes may also depend on the person and the situation. Importantly, even though the pain of a muscle cramp can be in a specific area, the cause may lie elsewhere. A cramp can almost never be explained just by local effects, and it involves both the whole body and your emotional state.",2,C

1,15902691,"Muscle cramps are a common problem characterized by a sudden, painful, involuntary contraction of muscle. These true cramps, which originate from peripheral nerves, may be distinguished from other muscle pain or spasm. Medical history, physical examination, and a limited laboratory screen help to determine the various causes of muscle cramps. Despite the ""benign"" nature of cramps, many patients find the symptom very uncomfortable. Treatment options are guided both by experience and by a limited number of therapeutic trials. Quinine sulfate is an effective medication, but the side-effect profile is worrisome, and other membrane-stabilizing drugs are probably just as effective. Patients will benefit from further studies to better define the pathophysiology of muscle cramps and to find more effective medications with fewer side-effects.","Muscle cramps are a common problem represented by sudden, painful, involuntary muscle contractions.

1,34346706,"Dystonia is a complex neurological movement disorder characterized by involuntary muscle contractions. Increasing studies implicate the microbiome as a possible key susceptibility factor for neurological disorders, but the relationship between the gut microbiota and dystonia remains poorly explored. Here, the gut microbiota of 57 patients with isolated dystonia and 27 age- and environment-matched healthy controls was analyzed by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Further, integrative analysis of the gut microbiome and serum metabolome measured by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was performed. No difference in α-diversity was found, while β-diversity was significantly different, with a more heterogeneous community structure among dystonia patients than among controls. The most significant changes in dystonia highlighted an increase in Clostridiales, including Blautia obeum, Dorea longicatena, and Eubacterium hallii, and a reduction in Bacteroides vulgatus and Bacteroides plebeius. The functional analysis revealed that genes related to tryptophan and purine biosynthesis were more abundant in gut microbiota from patients with dystonia, while genes linked to citrate cycle, vitamin B6, and glycan metabolism were less abundant. The evaluation of serum metabolites revealed altered levels of l-glutamic acid, taurine, and d-tyrosine, suggesting changes in neurotransmitter metabolism. The most modified metabolites strongly inversely correlated with the abundance of members belonging to the Clostridiales, revealing the effect of the gut microbiota on neurometabolic activity. This study is the first to reveal gut microbial dysbiosis in patients with isolated dystonia and identified potential links between gut microbiota and serum neurotransmitters, providing new insight into the pathogenesis of isolated dystonia. IMPORTANCE Dystonia is the third most common movement disorder after essential tremor and Parkinson's disease. However, the cause for the majority of cases is not known. This is the first study so far that reveals significant alterations of gut microbiome and correlates the alteration of serum metabolites with gut dysbiosis in patients with isolated dystonia. We demonstrated a general overrepresentation of Clostridiales and underrepresentation of Bacteroidetes in patients with dystonia in comparison with healthy controls. The functional analysis found that genes related to the biosynthesis of tryptophan, which is the precursor of the neurotransmitter serotonin, were more active in isolated dystonia patients. Altered levels of several serum metabolites were found to be associated with microbial changes, such as d-tyrosine, taurine, and glutamate, indicating differences in neurotransmitter metabolism in isolated dystonia. Integrative analysis suggests that neurotransmitter system dysfunction may be a possible pathway by which the gut microbiome participates in the development of dystonia. The gut microbiome changes provide new insight into the pathogenesis of dystonia, suggesting new potential therapeutic directions.","Dystonia is a complicated brain-related movement disorder with uncontrollable muscle contractions.

Further, we analyzed the gut microbiome and molecules in the blood. No change in some gut-diversity was found, while other gut-diversity was very different, with a more diverse community among dystonia patients than among healthy patients (controls). The most different change in dystonia showed an increase in certain types of microorganisms labeled Clostridiales, including Blautia obeum, Dorea longicatena, and Eubacterium hallii, and a reduction in other microorganisms labeled Bacteroides vulgatus and Bacteroides plebeius.

1,30237473,"Dystonia is a neurological condition characterized by abnormal involuntary movements or postures owing to sustained or intermittent muscle contractions. Dystonia can be the manifesting neurological sign of many disorders, either in isolation (isolated dystonia) or with additional signs (combined dystonia). The main focus of this Primer is forms of isolated dystonia of idiopathic or genetic aetiology. These disorders differ in manifestations and severity but can affect all age groups and lead to substantial disability and impaired quality of life. The discovery of genes underlying the mendelian forms of isolated or combined dystonia has led to a better understanding of its pathophysiology. In some of the most common genetic dystonias, such as those caused by TOR1A, THAP1, GCH1 and KMT2B mutations, and idiopathic dystonia, these mechanisms include abnormalities in transcriptional regulation, striatal dopaminergic signalling and synaptic plasticity and a loss of inhibition at neuronal circuits. The diagnosis of dystonia is largely based on clinical signs, and the diagnosis and aetiological definition of this disorder remain a challenge. Effective symptomatic treatments with pharmacological therapy (anticholinergics), intramuscular botulinum toxin injection and deep brain stimulation are available; however, future research will hopefully lead to reliable biomarkers, better treatments and cure of this disorder.","Dystonia is a disorder of the nervous system. It involves unusual posture or parts of your body moving in ways you can't control. Dystonia could be a sign of many underlying disorders, sometimes with other symptoms and sometimes not. We will focus on dystonia without other symptoms. This can be hereditary or have an unknown origin. Dystonia varies in how it appears, but it can affect all age groups, and can significantly impact daily life. We understand more about different types of dystonia since discovering the genes causing it. Some of the most common forms of hereditary dystonia are caused by mutations in genes called TOR1A, THAP1, GCH1 and KMT2B. These mutations may cause: problems with genes turning on or off; problems with sending or receiving dopamine (a neurotransmitter involved in motivation); problems adjusting the connections of brain cells; or problems suppressing unwanted brain activity. Dystonia is mainly diagnosed by signs a doctor can recognize. It is still difficult to diagnose and explain dystonia. Dystonia can be treated with: drugs (specifically anticholinergics, which block a neurotransmitter); injections of botulinum toxin (such as Botox); and insertion of electrodes into the brain. However, we hope that more research will produce better diagnostics, treatments, and maybe cures.",2,C

Potassium is a very important mineral in the body. Hyperkalemia is a important problem that happens mostly in people with long-lasting kidney disease. Some drugs can also cause an additional risk of hyperkalemia, especially in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). One such class of drugs, is the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (RAAS blockers). The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is a hormone system that manages blood pressure and fluid balance in the body. When hyperkalemia develops, doctors often advise patients to go on a diet that is lower in potassium. This study talks about the things that stop patients from following a low potassium diet. The paper also discusses what the effect of following a strict diet can have on poor patient outcomes. Facts are showing that a diet that includes foods high in potassium is good for your health. These same foods may be good for your health because they also contain other vitamins, minerals, and fiber. These benefits include lowering your blood pressure. The benefits also include lowering the risks for heart disease, blood vessel disease , and stroke. Foods high in potassium may also prevent chronic kidney disease (CKD) from getting worse. High-potassium foods may also decrease the risk of death in patients with CKD. Newer drugs, patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate, bind and get rid of excess potassium from the body. The use of these drugs may allow for renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor (RAAS blocker) therapy in patients with CKD and hyperkalemia. Doctors using these drugs together may make it possible for patients with CKD and hyperkalemia to have more freedom with their diets. This treatment approach may give patients the health benefits of a high-potassium diet without the increased risk for hyperkalemia. Further studies are needed.",2,C

Potassium is a very important mineral (electrolyte) in the body. Hyperkalemia can sometimes lead to death. Although there are many guidelines, all doctors do not agree on the best ways to take care of patients with different types of hyperkalemia. Types of hyperkalemia include acute (coming on rapidly), and chronic (long-lasting). This study discusses the serious issues and needs in the care of patients with hyperkalemia. Real-world studies are needed to understand how many patients have hyperkalemia that are not under research. Doctors need to improve the overall care of patients with hyperkalemia. This care includes knowing the type of hyperkalemia, how often to check the blood potassium levels, when to use the potassium-binder drugs that are taken by mouth, and when doctors can start the RAAS blocker drugs again. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is a hormone system that manages blood pressure and fluid balance in the body. Drugs that block the RAAS (RAAS blockers) have good effects on the cardiovascular system (heart and blood vessels). But the RAAS blockers can cause hyperkalemia. How often blood potassium levels are checked depends on the patient. Doctors should consider checking the blood levels more often in patients with chronic kidney disease, diabetes, heart failure, or a history of hyperkalemia and in patients taking RAAS blockers. Recent patient studies suggest that the newer potassium-binders (patiromer sorbitex calcium and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate) may help using the RAAS blockers and overall good treatment. Confidence in caring for patients with hyperkalemia may increase as primary care and internal medicine doctors learn more about the safety of the newer potassium-binders. More studies are required in order to know if strict low-potassium diets are needed in patients taking potassium-binders. Each patient's blood potassium levels should be checked as needed in patients at increased risk for hyperkalemia. Doing this, and using the newer potassium-binding drugs, may allow the best use of RAAS blockers and better overall care of patients with hyperkalemia.",2,C
3,16445274,"Hyperkalemia is a potentially life-threatening metabolic problem caused by inability of the kidneys to excrete potassium, impairment of the mechanisms that move potassium from the circulation into the cells, or a combination of these factors. Acute episodes of hyperkalemia commonly are triggered by the introduction of a medication affecting potassium homeostasis; illness or dehydration also can be triggers. In patients with diabetic nephropathy, hyperkalemia may be caused by the syndrome of hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism. The presence of typical electrocardiographic changes or a rapid rise in serum potassium indicates that hyperkalemia is potentially life threatening. Urine potassium, creatinine, and osmolarity should be obtained as a first step in determining the cause of hyperkalemia, which directs long-term treatment. Intravenous calcium is effective in reversing electrocardiographic changes and reducing the risk of arrhythmias but does not lower serum potassium. Serum potassium levels can be lowered acutely by using intravenous insulin and glucose, nebulized beta2 agonists, or both. Sodium polystyrene therapy, sometimes with intravenous furosemide and saline, is then initiated to lower total body potassium levels.","Hyperkalemia is a condition where the potassium level in the blood is higher than normal. Potassium is an important mineral in the body. Hyperkalemia is caused by problems with potasium metabolism and it can be life-threatening. It can be caused by a problem with the kidneys getting rid of the potassium through the urine. It can also be caused by a problem moving potassium into the cells from the bloodstream or both. Hyperkalemia that comes on rapidly is usually caused by an illness, dehydration, or by starting medicines that affect normal potassium balance in the body. Hyperkalemia can also be caused by other syndromes or conditions in patients with kidney diseases that are caused by diabetes. Signs that hyperkalemia may be life-threatening include EKG changes that are typically seen with high potassium levels or by a rapid rise in potassium levels on a blood test. Urine tests for potassium, creatinine (a waste product from muscles), and osmolality (the kidney's ability to balance water in urine) should be done as a first step in finding the cause for the hyperkalemia. Finding the cause for the hyperkalemia will have an effect on the ongoing treatment. Giving calcium through an IV can improve the abnormal EKG changes and reduce the risk of abnormal heartbeats, but this treatment does not lower the blood potassium level. Blood potassium levels can be lowered quickly by giving IV insulin and glucose, and by giving medicines called beta2 agonists through an inhaler or both. To then lower total body potassium levels, sodium polystyrene (a potassium-binding medicine) is started, sometimes with IV Lasix and saline.",2,C
3,29244647,"Hyperkalemia results either from the shift of potassium out of cells or from abnormal renal potassium excretion. Cell shift leads to transient increases in the plasma potassium concentration, whereas decreased renal excretion of potassium leads to sustained hyperkalemia. Impairments in renal potassium excretion can be the result of reduced sodium delivery to the distal nephron, decreased mineralocorticoid level or activity, or abnormalities in the cortical collecting duct. In some instances, all 3 of these perturbations are present. Excessive intake of potassium can cause hyperkalemia but usually in the setting of impaired renal function.

It can also be caused when the kidneys are not getting rid of enough potassium from the body through the urine. Hyperkalemia is temporary when too much comes out of the cells into the bloodstream. But, when the kidneys cannot get rid of enough potassium from the body, the hyperkalemia can last a longer time. There can be a few different reasons why the kidneys don't function correctly to get rid of potassium.  In some people, all the reasons are present at the same time.

Hypokalemia often is asymptomatic; symptoms are more common in older adults. Common symptoms are cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness or pain. Management consists of intravenous potassium replacement during cardiac monitoring for patients with marked symptoms, echocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities, or severe hypokalemia (ie, level less than 3.0 mEq/L). Oral replacement is appropriate for asymptomatic patients with less severe hypokalemia. Hyperkalemia (ie, level greater than 5.5 mEq/L) also can cause cardiac arrhythmias and muscle symptoms. Urgent management is warranted for patients with potassium levels of 6.5 mEq/L or greater, if ECG manifestations of hyperkalemia are present regardless of potassium levels, or if severe muscle symptoms occur. Urgent management includes intravenous calcium, intravenous insulin, and inhaled beta agonists. Hemodialysis can be used in urgent situations. For patients with less severe hyperkalemia, renal elimination drugs sometimes are used, as are gastrointestinal elimination drugs.

3,26721532,"Purpose: Emerging treatment options for the management of chronic hyperkalemia in the outpatient setting are reviewed. Summary: Current treatment options for the management of hyperkalemia are limited and often accompanied by serious adverse effects. Two investigational drugs for the treatment of hyperkalemia are being evaluated in Phase III trials: sodium zirconium cyclosilicate and patiromer. Both of these drugs are administered orally and act by enhancing potassium's removal, predominantly through the gastrointestinal tract. The safety and efficacy of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate and patiromer were evaluated in Phase II and III trials. Both agents were studied in patients with chronic mild-to-severe hyperkalemia, chronic kidney disease (CKD), or heart failure as well as those taking a renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitor, an aldosterone antagonist, or both therapies. These clinical trials found that sodium zirconium cyclosilicate and patiromer normalized serum potassium levels quickly and maintained normalized serum potassium levels over several weeks. Both medications caused a rapid decrease in serum potassium, with two studies examining efficacy endpoints for 12 weeks or longer. The overall frequency of adverse effects in these clinical trials was low, with gastrointestinal adverse events being the most commonly observed. Conclusion: Options for the management of hyperkalemia, particularly chronic hyperkalemia in the outpatient setting, are limited. Both sodium zirconium cyclosilicate and patiromer are emerging therapies that may provide long-term management of hyperkalemia, particularly in patients with underlying heart failure or CKD as well as those taking an RAS inhibitor, an aldosterone antagonist, or both.","New treatments for long-lasting (chronic) hyperkalemia to take care of patients not in the hospital (outpatients) are being researched. Current treatments for hyperkalemia are few and often have serious side effects. Two new drugs are being researched for the treatment of hyperkalemia in new patient studies (clinical trials). Their names are sodium zirconium cyclosilicate and patiromer. Both of these drugs are given by mouth. They act by increasing the removal of potassium from the body, mostly through the gastrointestinal tract. The gastrointestinal tract includes the stomach and the bowels. These drugs have already been studied in people for their safety and effectiveness in past clinical trials. These clinical trials included patients with chronic hyperkalemia (ranging from mild to severe), chronic kidney disease, or heart failure. These research trials also included patients taking other drugs at the same time. These other drugs included a class of drugs that block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system called RAAS blockers. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is a hormone system that manages blood pressure and fluid balance in the body. These clinical trials found that sodium zirconium cyclosilicate and patiromer brought the blood potassium levels down to normal quickly and kept the blood levels of potassium normal for several weeks. Both drugs caused a fast decrease in blood potassium levels. Two of these patient trials studied the effectiveness for 12 weeks or longer. The overall number of side effects in these patient studies was low. The most common side effects seen were related to the gastrointestinal tract. Doctors don’t have a lot of ways to treat hyperkalemia, especially chronic hyperkalemia if the patient is not in the hospital.

In addition, we examine the potential nondialysis options for the management of these patients, including use of the newer K+ binder agents patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate, which may reduce the need for the highly restrictive dialysis diet, with its own implication on nutritional status in patients with ESRD, as well as reducing the risk of potentially life-threatening hyperkalemia.","Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on regular, ongoing (maintenance) dialysis have a high risk of developing hyperkalemia.

3,31268919,"Purpose of review: Hyperkalemia is a potentially fatal electrolyte disorder, more commonly present when the potassium excretion capacity is imparied. Hyperkalemia can lead to adverse outcomes, especially due to severe cardiac arrhythmias. It can also impair the cardiovascular effects of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASis) and potassium rich diets, as hyperkalemia frequently leads to their discontinuation. Recent findings: Potassium is a predictor of mortality and should be monitored closely for patients who are at risk for hyperkalemia. Acute hyperkalemia protocols have been revised and updated. Randomized trials have shown that the new anti-hyperkalemic agents (patiromer and zirconium cyclosilicate) are effective hyperkalemia treatment options. The use of anti-hyperkalemic agents may allow for a less restrictive potassium diet and lower RAASi discontinuation rates. Summary: Hyperkalemia should be monitored closely for high-risk patients, as it is associated with adverse outcomes. New therapies have demonstrated effective control, offering hope for potential use in patients that would benefit from diet or medications associated with an increase in serum potassium, indicating that the use of hyperkalemic agents can be associated with better outcomes.","Hyperkalemia is a condition where the potassium level in the blood is higher than normal. Potassium is a very important mineral (electrolyte) in the body. Hyperkalemia is a potentially fatal electrolyte disorder. It more likely occurs when the body cannot get rid of potassium as well as it should. Hyperkalemia can lead to serious problems. Especially because hyperkalemia can cause severe problems with the heart beat. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is a hormone system that manages blood pressure and fluid balance in the body. Drugs that block the RAAS (RAAS blockers) have good effects on the cardiovascular system (heart and blood vessels). But the RAAS blockers can cause hyperkalemia. High-potassium diets can also have good effects on the cardiovascular system. But doctors have to stop giving these RAAS blockers and also recommend low-potassium diets in patients with hyperkalemia. Potassium can predict mortality. Potassium levels should be checked often in patients at risk for hyperkalemia. The rules for treating hyperkalemia that occurs rapidly have been updated. Patient studies have shown that the new drugs to treat hyperkalemia (patiromer and zirconium cyclosilicate) work well to treat hyperkalemia. These new drugs may let doctors continue to use the RAAS blockers more often. Doctors may be able to recommend less strict potassium diets too. Hyperkalemia should be closely watched for in high-risk patients because it can lead to poor outcomes. New drugs have been shown to work well. There is hope that these new drugs can control the blood potassium levels in patients that would benefit from RAAS blockers and diets higher in potassium, leading to better overall treatment results.",2,C

However, FPG and OGTT have themselves never been validated in children. Studies to validate diagnostic thresholds in children appear unlikely to take place. Thus, accepting the major ADA diagnostic criteria appears to be the best course of action for the pediatric community. One area in which correlation studies between HbA1c and FPG or OGTT might shed light is in the definition of criteria for intervention in 'pre-diabetes,' as the Diabetes Prevention Program Trial did not use HbA1c.

4,33651569,"The classification of diabetes was originally limited to only two categories called juvenile-onset diabetes mellitus, now known as type 1 diabetes mellitus, and adult-onset diabetes mellitus, now known as type 2 diabetes mellitus. This has grown to a recognition of more than 50 subcategories caused by various pathogenic mechanisms or accompanying other diseases and syndromes. The diagnosis of diabetes has evolved from physician recognition of typical symptoms to detection of ambient hyperglycemia and, thence, to the definition of excessive plasma glucose levels after an overnight fast and/or following challenge with a glucose load (oral glucose tolerance test or OGTT), and more recently, by measurement of glycated hemoglobin (A1c). Screening has uncovered a much higher prevalence of diabetes in the United States and elsewhere, as well as its enormous public health impact. Modern testing has defined individuals at high risk for the development of diabetes and pregnant women whose fetuses are at increased risk for mortality and morbidity. Diagnostic glycemic criteria for presymptomatic diabetes have been set using diabetic retinopathy as a specific complication of the disease: A1c ≥6.5%; fasting plasma glucose (FPG) ≥126 mg/dL; or plasma glucose measured 2 hours after an OGTT (2-hour PG) ≥200 mg/dL. For patients with typical symptoms, a random plasma glucose ≥200 mg/dL is diagnostic. The 2-hour PG yields the highest prevalence and A1c the lowest. A1c is the most convenient and practical test, requiring no preparation, is analytically superior, and has the lowest intraindividual variation. It is more expensive than the FPG, but the same or less than the OGTT. The 2-hour PG is the most burdensome to the patient and has the highest intraindividual variation. Standardized measurement of A1c is not available everywhere. Confirmation of an abnormal test with the same test is recommended. Studies in various populations show inconsistency among the glycemic tests. Of people meeting the A1c criterion, 27%–98% meet plasma glucose criteria. Of people meeting plasma glucose criteria, 17%–78% meet the A1c criterion. These discrepancies occur because each test measures different aspects of hyperglycemia that may vary among patients. While the risk of future diabetes is continuously associated with plasma glucose and A1c, the areas between the upper limits of normal and the diabetes cutpoints have been called “prediabetes” or “high risk for diabetes.” These have been defined categorically as A1c 6.0%–6.4% or 5.7%–6.4%; impaired fasting glucose (IFG), FPG 100–125 mg/dL; and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), 2-hour PG 140–199 mg/dL. A1c 6.0%–6.4% increases the odds ratio (OR) for progression to diabetes (OR 12.5–16) more than the range of 5.7%–6.4% (OR 9.2). In U.S. studies, the incidence of type 2 diabetes averages approximately 6% per year in people with IGT and can reverse spontaneously. IFG is more prevalent than IGT in the United States, though IGT rises more sharply with age. IFG increases the risk of future diabetes to various degrees in different countries, with odds ratios ranging from 2.9 to 18.5.","Classifying diabetes was originally limited to either juvenile-onset diabetes mellitus, or type 1 diabetes mellitus, and adult-onset diabetes mellitus, or type 2 diabetes mellitus. Classification of diabetes now recognizes over 50 subcategories by disease-causing biological processes or accompanying diseases. Diagnosing diabetes has grown from a physician recognizing typical signs to detecting high blood sugar to defining high blood sugar after an overnight fast and/or tolerance test with glucose (a simple sugar). Recently, the diagnosis involves measuring glycated hemoglobin (A1c), an iron-rich protein in blood joined to a sugar. Testing now shows higher widespreadness of and enormous public health impact of diabetes in the United States and elsewhere. Current testing has detected those at risk for diabetes and pregnant women whose fetuses are at higher risk for death and illness. Diagnostic glycemic (blood sugar) criteria for before-symptom diabetes have been set using diabetic retinopathy (eye-affecting diabetes) as a specific effect of the disease: A1c ≥6.5%; fasting plasma glucose (FPG) ≥126 mg/dL; or blood glucose (sugar) measured 2 hours after an OGTT (2-hour PG) ≥200 mg/dL. For patients with typical symptoms, a random blood glucose ≥200 mg/dL is diagnostic.

Of people meeting the A1c criterion, 27%–98% meet plasma glucose criteria. Of people meeting plasma glucose criteria, 17%–78% meet the A1c criterion. These discrepancies occur because each test measures different aspects of hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) that may vary among patients. While the risk of future diabetes is continuously associated with plasma glucose and A1c, the areas between the upper limits of normal and the diabetes cutpoints have been called “prediabetes” or “high risk for diabetes.” These have been defined categorically as A1c 6.0%–6.4% or 5.7%–6.4%; impaired fasting glucose (IFG), FPG 100–125 mg/dL; and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), 2-hour PG 140–199 mg/dL. A1c 6.0%–6.4% increases the odds ratio (OR) for progression to diabetes (OR 12.5–16) more than the range of 5.7%–6.4% (OR 9.2). In U.S. studies, the incidence of type 2 diabetes averages approximately 6% per year in people with IGT and can reverse spontaneously. IFG is more prevalent than IGT in the United States, though IGT rises more sharply with age. IFG increases the risk of future diabetes to various degrees in different countries, with odds ratios ranging from 2.9 to 18.5.",2,C

Reliable distinction between these diagnoses is essential as treatment differs substantially, with the wrong treatment potentially leading to serious complications.

With the establishment of copeptin, a stable and reliable surrogate marker for arginine vasopressin, diagnosis of the polyuria-polydipsia syndrome has been newly evaluated. Whereas unstimulated basal copeptin measurement reliably diagnoses nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, two new tests using stimulated copeptin cutoff levels showed a high diagnostic accuracy in differentiating central diabetes insipidus from primary polydipsia. For the hypertonic saline infusion test, osmotic stimulation via the induction of hypernatraemia is used. This makes the test highly reliable and superior to the classical water deprivation test, but also requires close supervision and the availability of rapid sodium measurements to guarantee the safety of the test.

4,30259503,"Introduction: Maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a rare form of monogenic diabetes. Being clinically and genetically heterogeneous, it is often misdiagnosed as type 1 or type 2 diabetes, leading to inappropriate therapy. MODY is caused by a single gene mutation. Thirteen genes, defining 13 subtypes, have been identified to cause MODY. A correct diagnosis is important for the right therapy, prognosis, and genetic counselling. Material and methods: Twenty-nine unrelated paediatric patients clinically suspected of having MODY diabetes were analysed using TruSight One panel for next-generation sequencing (NGS) and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) assay. Results: In this study we identified variants in MODY genes in 22 out of 29 patients (75.9%). Using two genetic tests, NGS and MLPA, we detected both single nucleotide variants and large deletions in patients. Most of the patients harboured a variant in the GCK gene (11/22), followed by HNF1B (5/22). The rest of the variants were found in the NEUROD1 and HNF1A genes. We identified one novel variant in the GCK gene: c.596T>C, p.Val199Ala. The applied genetic tests excluded the suspected diagnosis of MODY in two patients and revealed variants in other genes possibly associated with the patient's clinical phenotype. Conclusions: In our group of MODY patients most variants were found in the GCK gene, followed by variants in HNF1B, NEUROD1, and HNF1A genes. The combined NGS and MLPA-based genetic tests presented a comprehensive approach for analysing patients with suspected MODY diabetes and provided a successful differential diagnosis of MODY subtypes.","The study's introduction states that the maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a rare form of single-gene-causing diabetes.

4,20150843,"The International Expert Committee recommends that the diagnosis of diabetes be made if hemo globin A1c (HbA1c) level is greater, similar 6.5% and confirmed with a repeat HbA1c test. The committee recommends against ""mixing different methods to diagnose diabetes"" because ""the tests are not completely concordant: using different tests could easily lead to confusion"". Fasting plasma glucose, 2-hour postglucose-load plasma glucose, and oral glucose tolerance tests are recommended for the diagnosis of diabetes only if HbA1c testing is not possible due to unavailability of the assay, patient factors that preclude its inter pretation, and during pregnancy. HbA1c testing has the advantages of greater clinical convenience, preanalytic stability, and assay standardization, but when used as the sole diagnostic criterion for diabetes, it has the potential for systematic error. Factors that may not be clinically evident impact HbA1c test results and may systematically raise or lower the value relative to the true level of glycemia. For this reason, HbA1c should be used in combination with plasma glucose determinations for the diagnosis of diabetes. If an HbA1c test result is discordant with the clinical picture or equivocal, plasma glucose testing should be performed. A diagnostic cut-off point of HbA1c greater, similar 6.5% misses a substantial number of people with type 2 diabetes, including some with fasting hyperglycemia, and misses most people with impaired glucose tolerance. Combining the use of HbA1c and plasma glucose measurements for the diagnosis of diabetes offers the benefits of each test and reduces the risk of systematic bias inherent in HbA1c testing alone.","An international committee recommends diagnosing diabetes if hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), an iron-rich blood protein joined to a sugar, is at or over 6.5% with multiple tests. The committee recommends not ""mixing different methods to diagnose diabetes"" because ""the tests are not completely concordant [or consistent]: using different tests could easily lead to confusion"". Fasting blood sugar tests and blood sugar tests after simple sugar intake may help identify diabetes only if testing for HbA1c is not possible. HbA1c testing is useful for greater convenience, accuracy, and uniformity, but as the single tool for identification, it may lead to measurement errors. Unknown factors may alter scores of the iron-rich blood protein relative to the actual blood sugar level. Thus, tests for this iron-rich blood protein connected to a sugar should be combined with other blood sugar values for diabetes identification. If a score for HbA1c disagrees with the general reading, blood sugar testing should be performed. A cut-off point at or over 6.5% for HbA1c misses many with type 2 diabetes, high fasting blood sugar, and impaired blood sugar sensitivity. Using tests for HbA1c and blood sugar measurements identifies diabetes better than HbA1c tests alone.",2,C

4,22059988,"Highly sensitive and specific radioimmunoassays have been validated for autoantibodies reacting with the four major autoantigens identified so far in autoimmune diabetes. However, the analysis of this large number of autoantigens has increased the costs and time necessary for complete autoantibody screenings. Our aim was to demonstrate that it is possible to detect the immunoreactivity against a combination of four different autoantigens by a single assay, this representing a rapid, low-cost first approach to evaluate humoral autoimmunity in diabetes. By using this novel multi-autoantigen radioimmunoassay (MAA), in subsequent steps we analysed 830 sera, 476 of known and 354 of unknown diabetes-specific immunoreactivity, collected from various groups of individuals including type 1 and type 2 diabetes patients, autoantibody-positive patients with a clinical diagnosis of type 2 diabetes (LADA), prediabetic subjects, individuals at risk to develop autoimmune diabetes, siblings of type 1 diabetic patients, coeliac patients and healthy control subjects. All sera reacting with one or more of the four autoantigens by single assays also resulted positive with MAA, as well as eight of 24 type 1 diabetic patients classified initially as autoantibody-negative at disease onset based on single autoantibody assays. In addition, MAA showed 92% sensitivity and 99% specificity by analysing 140 blinded sera from type 1 diabetic patients and control subjects provided in the 2010 Diabetes Autoantibody Standardization Program. MAA is the first combined method also able to evaluate, in addition to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) and tyrosine phosphatase (IA)-2, insulin and islet beta-cell zinc cation efflux transporter (ZnT8) autoantibodies. It appears to be particularly appropriate as a first-line approach for large-scale population-based screenings of anti-islet autoimmunity.","Certain precise measuring tools can measure specific, self-made proteins that tag four major markers of autoimmune diabetes (diabetes from the body mistakenly destroying its own cells). However, analysis of these many self-made markers increases costs and time for measurements.

With this new measuring tool, which is called a multi-autoantigen radioimmunoassay (MAA), we measured 830 blood samples, 476 of known and 354 of unknown diabetes type. These samples came from type 1 and type 2 diabetics, slow-progressing type 2 diabetics, prediabetics, individuals at risk to develop autoimmune diabetes, siblings of type 1 diabetics, gluten-sensitive patients, and healthy patients. All blood reacting with one or more of the four self-made markers by other tools also reacts with MAA, along with eight more, type 1 diabetics whose blood did not react with other tools. Also, MAA shows high accuracy for disease detection and no detection after analysing 140 unknown blood samples from type 1 diabetics and healthy patients.

Pertinent articles of interest were identified by title and where available abstract for further review. Additional references were identified in the course of review of the literature identified. Results: Physicians have intervened in cases of thyroid dysfunction for more than two millennia. Ingestion of animal thyroid derived preparations has been long described but only scientifically documented for the last 130 years. Refinements in hormone preparation, pharmaceutical production and regulation continue to this day. The literature provides documentation of physiologic, pathologic and clinical outcomes which have been reported and continuously updated. Recommendations for effective and safe use of these hormones for reversal of patho-physiology associated with hypothyroidism and the relief of symptoms of hypothyroidism has documented a progressive refinement in our understanding of thyroid hormone use. Studies of thyroid hormone metabolism, action and pharmacokinetics have allowed evermore focused recommendations for use in clinical practice. Levothyroxine mono-therapy has emerged as the therapy of choice of all recent major guidelines.

Subacute thyroiditis is a transient thyrotoxic state characterized by anterior neck pain, suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone, and low radioactive iodine uptake on thyroid scanning. Many cases of subacute thyroiditis follow an upper respiratory viral illness, which is thought to trigger an inflammatory destruction of thyroid follicles.

6,32001830,"In the 1990s, selenium was identified as a component of an enzyme that activates thyroid hormone; since this discovery, the relevance of selenium to thyroid health has been widely studied. Selenium, known primarily for the antioxidant properties of selenoenzymes, is obtained mainly from meat, seafood and grains. Intake levels vary across the world owing largely to differences in soil content and factors affecting its bioavailability to plants. Adverse health effects have been observed at both extremes of intake, with a narrow optimum range. Epidemiological studies have linked an increased risk of autoimmune thyroiditis, Graves disease and goitre to low selenium status. Trials of selenium supplementation in patients with chronic autoimmune thyroiditis have generally resulted in reduced thyroid autoantibody titre without apparent improvements in the clinical course of the disease. In Graves disease, selenium supplementation might lead to faster remission of hyperthyroidism and improved quality of life and eye involvement in patients with mild thyroid eye disease. Despite recommendations only extending to patients with Graves ophthalmopathy, selenium supplementation is widely used by clinicians for other thyroid phenotypes. Ongoing and future trials might help identify individuals who can benefit from selenium supplementation, based, for instance, on individual selenium status or genetic profile.","In the 1990s, selenium was found to be a part of a protein that helps produce thyroid hormone. Since this discovery, many scientists have studied how selenium might help thyroid health. Selenium, which has antioxidant characteristics, is found in meat, seafood and grains. The amount of selenium eaten varies across the world due to different soils and how much of it plants absorb. Eating too much or too little selenium can cause health problems, with a small ideal range for consumption. Studies that look at how often diseases occur in different groups of people and why show a relationship between eating too little selenium and higher rates of inflamed thyroid caused by thyroid cells that are attacked by infection-preventing cells, Graves disease (a disease in which infection-preventing cells attack healthy cells and lead to an overactive thyroid), and enlarged thyroids. Studies of people taking selenium who have long-term inflamed thyroids caused by thyroid cells attacked by infection-preventing cells generally have bloodwork that suggests more normal thyroid function but no improvement in symptoms. In Graves disease, taking selenium might make overactive thyroid go away faster and make quality of life and eye problems better in people with mild thyroid eye disease. Although selenium is only recommended for people with thyroid eye disease, doctors prescribe selenium for other thyroid problems. Current and future studies might help determine who should take selenium based, for example, on blood selenium levels and heredity.",1,B
6,31071734,"Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) is the most prevalent autoimmune disorder characterized by the destruction of thyroid cells caused by leukocytes and antibody-mediated immune processes accompanied by hypothyroidism. In recent years, evidence has emerged pointing to various roles for vitamin D, including, proliferation and differentiation of normal and cancer cells, cardiovascular function, and immunomodulation. Vitamin D deficiency has been especially demonstrated in HT patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of vitamin D on circulating thyroid autoantibodies and thyroid hormones profile (T4, T3, and TSH) in females with HT. Forty-two women with HT disease were enrolled in this randomized clinical trial study and divided into vitamin D and placebo groups. Patients in the vitamin D and placebo groups received 50 000 IU vitamin D and placebo pearls, weekly for 3 months, respectively. The serum levels of 25-hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH) D], Ca++ion, anti-thyroperoxidase antibody (anti-TPO Ab), anti-thyroglobulin antibody (anti-Tg Ab), T4, T3, and TSH were measured at the baseline and at the end of the study using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The results of this study showed a significant reduction of anti-Tg Ab and TSH hormone in the Vitamin D group compared to the start of the study; however, there was a no significant reduction of anti-TPO Ab in the Vitamin D group compared to the placebo group (p=0.08). No significant changes were observed in the serum levels of T3 and T4 hormones. Therefore, vitamin D supplementation can be helpful for alleviation of the disease activity in HT patients; however, further well controlled, large, longitudinal studies are needed to determine whether it can be introduced in clinical practice.","Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) is the most common type of disease caused by thyroid cells that are attacked by infection-preventing cells and results in an underactive thyroid. Recently, science has shown vitamin D can change how normal and cancer cells grow, divide, and change from one cell to another, how the heart works, and how the body's immune system changes. Too little vitamin D is seen in people with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. This study aimed to determine the effect of vitamin D on thyroid autoantibodies (substances that develop when a person's immune system mistakenly attacks the thyroid) and thyroid hormone (T4, T3, and thyroid-stimulating hormone) blood levels in women. We split 42 women with HT disease into two groups and gave one group vitamin D and the other group sham treatment.

Blood levels of one antibody and thyroid-stimulating hormone were lower at the end of the study in the group taking vitamin D. The group taking vitamin D and the group taking sugar pills had similar blood levels of another antibody. Blood levels of T3 and T4 hormones did not change in either group. Therefore, taking vitamin D can help people with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. However, more large studies done over time are needed to see if it can be used in patient care.",1,B
6,27852303,"Background: Hashimoto's thyroiditis is an autoimmune disorder and the most common cause of hypothyroidism. The use of Nigella sativa, a potent herbal medicine, continues to increase worldwide as an alternative treatment of several chronic diseases including hyperlipidemia, hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The aim of the current study was to evaluate the effects of Nigella sativa on thyroid function, serum Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) - 1, Nesfatin-1 and anthropometric features in patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Methods: Forty patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, aged between 22 and 50 years old, participated in the trial and were randomly allocated into two groups of intervention and control receiving powdered Nigella sativa or placebo daily for 8 weeks. Changes in anthropometric variables, dietary intakes, thyroid status, serum VEGF and Nesfatin-1 concentrations after 8 weeks were measured. Results: Treatment with Nigella sativa significantly reduced body weight and body mass index (BMI). Serum concentrations of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) antibodies decreased while serum T3 concentrations increased in Nigella sativa-treated group after 8 weeks. There was a significant reduction in serum VEGF concentrations in intervention group. None of these changes had been observed in placebo treated group. In stepwise multiple regression model, changes in waist to hip ratio (WHR) and thyroid hormones were significant predictors of changes in serum VEGF and Nesgfatin-1 values in Nigella sativa treated group (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Our data showed a potent beneficial effect of powdered Nigella sativa in improving thyroid status and anthropometric variables in patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Moreover, Nigella sativa significantly reduced serum VEGF concentrations in these patients. Considering observed health- promoting effect of this medicinal plant in ameliorating the disease severity, it can be regarded as a useful therapeutic approach in management of Hashimoto's thyroiditis.","Hashimoto's thyroiditis is caused by thyroid cells that are attacked by infection-preventing cells and is the most common cause of an underactive thyroid.

We randomly split forty people with Hashimoto's thyroiditis and between 22 and 50 years old into two group and gave one group powdered Nigella sativa and the other group sham treatment for 8 weeks. We measured changes in physical body measurements, what people ate, thyroid function, blood VEGF and Nefastin-1 levels after 8 weeks. Taking Nigella sativa caused lower body weight and body mass index (BMI). People taking Nigella sativa had lower blood levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone and antibodies that target the thyroid and higher levels of blood thyroid hormone (T4) after 8 weeks. People taking Nigella sativa had lower blood levels of VEGF. None of these changes were seen in the group who took the sham treatmentl. Based on a statistical model, changes in the ratio of the waist to the hip and thyroid hormones predicted changes in blood VEGF and Nesgfatin-1 levels in the group who took Nigella sativa. We concluded that powdered Nigella sativa improved thyroid function and physical body measurements in people with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Nigella sativa lowered blood VEGF levels.

The aim of the current study was to evaluate the effects of Nigella sativa on thyroid function, serum Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) - 1, Nesfatin-1 and anthropometric features in patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Methods: Forty patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, aged between 22 and 50 years old, participated in the trial and were randomly allocated into two groups of intervention and control receiving powdered Nigella sativa or placebo daily for 8 weeks. Changes in anthropometric variables, dietary intakes, thyroid status, serum VEGF and Nesfatin-1 concentrations after 8 weeks were measured. Results: Treatment with Nigella sativa significantly reduced body weight and body mass index (BMI). Serum concentrations of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) antibodies decreased while serum T3 concentrations increased in Nigella sativa-treated group after 8 weeks. There was a significant reduction in serum VEGF concentrations in intervention group. None of these changes had been observed in placebo treated group. In stepwise multiple regression model, changes in waist to hip ratio (WHR) and thyroid hormones were significant predictors of changes in serum VEGF and Nesgfatin-1 values in Nigella sativa treated group (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Our data showed a potent beneficial effect of powdered Nigella sativa in improving thyroid status and anthropometric variables in patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Moreover, Nigella sativa significantly reduced serum VEGF concentrations in these patients. Considering observed health- promoting effect of this medicinal plant in ameliorating the disease severity, it can be regarded as a useful therapeutic approach in management of Hashimoto's thyroiditis.","Hashimoto's thyroiditis (thyroid inflammation) occurs when immune cells mistakenly attack the body's own healthy cells. It is the most common cause of reduced thyroid function. Nigella sativa, a powerful herbal medicine, increases globally as an alternative treatment for many long-lasting diseases like high blood pressure, high blood fat, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The current work evaluates how Nigella sativa affects thyroid function, blood protein levels, and physical measurements in those with Hashimoto's thyroid inflammation. Forty patients with Hashimoto's thyroid inflammation, aged 22 through 50, were randomly split into two groups receiving powdered Nigella sativa or inactive treatment daily for 8 weeks. Using an herbal medicine reduced body weight and body mass index. Blood levels of thyroid stimulating hormone and anti-thyroid cell proteins decreased while thyroid product levels increased in the Nigella sative-treated group after 8 weeks. The treatment group showed reduced blood vessel signaling protein. No changes occured in the inactive treatment group. Changes in waist to hip ratio and thyroid hormones were linked to changes in certain blood protein levels in the Nigella sative-treated group. Nigella sativa may improve thyroid and general health in those with Hashimoto's thyroiditis (thyroid inflammation). Also, Nigella sativa (an herbal medicine) reduces blood vessel signaling protein in these patients. Due to its health-promoting effect, this medicinal plant can be a useful treatment for Hashimoto's thyroidits.",2,B
6,32740045,"Purpose of review: The aim of the article is to present the basics of oral levothyroxine (LT4) absorption, reasons why patients may have persistently elevated serum thyroid stimulation hormone (TSH) levels, and alternative strategies for LT4 dosing. Recent findings: Although oral LT4 tablets are most commonly used for thyroid hormone replacement in patients with hypothyroidism, case studies report that liquid oral LT4, intravenous, intramuscular, and rectal administration of LT4 can successfully treat refractory hypothyroidism. Summary: Hypothyroidism is one of the most common endocrine disorders encountered by primary care physicians and endocrinologists. LT4 is one of the most widely prescribed medications in the world and it is the standard of care treatment for hypothyroidism. Generally, hypothyroid patients will be treated with LT4 tablets to be taken orally, and monitoring will occur with routine serum thyroid tests, including TSH concentrations. However, many patients fail to maintain serum TSH levels in the target range while managed on oral LT4 tablets. A subset of these patients would be considered to have poorly controlled hypothyroidism, sometimes termed refractory hypothyroidism. For these patients, optimization of ingestion routines and alternative formulations and routes of administration of LT4 can be considered, including oral liquid, intravenous, intramuscular, and even rectal formulations.","This article aims to cover the basics of how well levothyroxine (LT4 - a common thyroid medication) is absorbed when taken by mouth, reasons why people may have continuously high blood levels of thyroid stimulating hormone, and other ways to take levothyroxine. Although LT4 tablets taken by mouth are most commonly used for thyroid hormone replacement in people with underactive thyroids, studies show that taking LT4 in liquid-form by mouth, shot to a vein or muscle, and through the rectum can work to treat poorly-controlled underactive thyroid. Underactive thyroid is one of the most common hormone disorders doctors see. LT4 is one of the most commonly prescribed drugs in the world and is the recommended treatment for underactive thyroid. Generally, people with underactive thyroids will take LT4 tablets by mouth and track thryoid levels with common blood thyroid tests, including measuring levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone. Taking LT4 tablets by mouth does not keep blood thyroid-stimulating hormone levels at the right level for many people. Some of these people may have poorly-controlled underactive thyroids, or refractory underactive thyroids. This group of people might need to take LT4 in other forms or other ways, including liquid-form by mouth, shot to a vein or muscle, or even through the rectum.",1,B
6,29490937,"Hypothyroidism is one of the most common hormone deficiencies in adults. Most of the cases, particularly those of overt hypothyroidism, are easily diagnosed and managed, with excellent outcomes if treated adequately. However, minor alterations of thyroid function determine nonspecific manifestations. Primary hypothyroidism due to chronic autoimmune thyroiditis is largely the most common cause of thyroid hormone deficiency. Central hypothyroidism is a rare and heterogeneous disorder characterized by decreased thyroid hormone secretion by an otherwise normal thyroid gland, due to lack of TSH. The standard treatment of primary and central hypothyroidism is hormone replacement therapy with levothyroxine sodium (LT4). Treatment guidelines of hypothyroidism recommend monotherapy with LT4 due to its efficacy, long-term experience, favorable side effect profile, ease of administration, good intestinal absorption, long serum half-life and low cost. Despite being easily treatable with a daily dose of LT4, many patients remain hypothyroid due to malabsorption syndromes, autoimmune gastritis, pancreatic and liver disorders, drug interactions, polymorphisms in DIO2 (iodothyronine deiodinase 2), high fiber diet, and more frequently, non-compliance to LT4 therapy. Compliance to levothyroxine treatment in hypothyroidism is compromised by daily and fasting schedule. Many adult patients remain hypothyroid due to all the above mentioned and many attempts to improve levothyroxine therapy compliance and absorption have been made.","Underactive thyroid is one of the most common conditions caused by a lack of specific hormones in adults. Underactive thyroid is usually easily identified and successfully treated. However, small changes in thyroid function determine symptoms that can be caused by many conditions. Primary underactive thyroid caused by a long-term inflamed thyroid, which in turn is caused by thyroid cells that are attacked by infection-preventing cells, is the most common cause of too little thyroid hormones in adults. Central underactive thyroid, which is not very common and has many causes, is when an otherwise normal thyroid makes too little thyroid hormone due to lack of thyroid-stimulating hormone. Thyroid hormone replacement with levothyroxine (LT4) is the normal treatment of primary and central underactive thyroid. Treatment guidelines for an underactive thyroid recommend a single drug, levothyroxine (LT4), because of how well it works, how long it has been used, few side effects, how easy it is to use, how well it is absorbed in the stomach, how long it lasts in the blood, and low cost. Although taking LT4 daily treats underactive thyroid, many people still have underactive thyroids due to conditions that do not allow absorption in the stomach, inflammation of the stomach lining caused by thyroid cells that are attacked by infection-preventing cells, pancreatic and live disease, two or more drugs interacting with each other, gene variations, eating too much fiber, and more commonly, not following the prescribed LT4 treatment. Taking levothyroxine as prescribed for underactive thyroid depends on when and if it is taken on an empty stomach. For all of these reasons, many adults still have underactive thyroids. Doctors have tried many ways to make people take levothyroxine as prescribed and make levothyroxine more easily absorbed in the stomach.",1,B
6,29381251,"Objective: Hypothyroidism is relatively common, occurring in approximately 5% of the general US population aged ≥12 years. Levothyroxine (LT4) monotherapy is the standard of care. Approximately, 5%-10% of patients who normalise thyroid-stimulating hormone levels with LT4 monotherapy may have persistent symptoms that patients and clinicians may attribute to hypothyroidism. A long-standing debate in the literature is whether addition of levotriiodothyronine (LT3) to LT4 will ameliorate lingering symptoms. Here, we explore the evidence for and against LT4/LT3 combination therapy as the optimal approach to treat euthyroid patients with persistent complaints.

Relevant non-review articles published in English during the past 10 years were included and supplemented with articles already known to the authors. Findings: Current clinical evidence is not sufficiently strong to support LT4/LT3 combination therapy in patients with hypothyroidism.

However, results of studies on the effect of LT4/LT3 therapy on clinical symptoms and thyroid-responsive genes have thus far not been conclusive. Conclusions: Persistent symptoms in patients who are biochemically euthyroid with LT4 monotherapy may be caused by several other conditions unrelated to thyroid function, and their cause should be aggressively investigated by the clinician.","Underactive thyroid is relatively common, occurring in about 5% of the general U.S. population 12 years and older.

6,26926973,"Hyperthyroidism is an excessive concentration of thyroid hormones in tissues caused by increased synthesis of thyroid hormones, excessive release of preformed thyroid hormones, or an endogenous or exogenous extrathyroidal source. The most common causes of an excessive production of thyroid hormones are Graves disease, toxic multinodular goiter, and toxic adenoma. The most common cause of an excessive passive release of thyroid hormones is painless (silent) thyroiditis, although its clinical presentation is the same as with other causes. Hyperthyroidism caused by overproduction of thyroid hormones can be treated with antithyroid medications (methimazole and propylthiouracil), radioactive iodine ablation of the thyroid gland, or surgical thyroidectomy. Radioactive iodine ablation is the most widely used treatment in the United States. The choice of treatment depends on the underlying diagnosis, the presence of contraindications to a particular treatment modality, the severity of hyperthyroidism, and the patient's preference.","Overactive thyroid is when too much thyroid hormone produced, when too much stored thyroid hormone released, or when there are internal or external thyroid hormone sources outside the thyroid. The most common causes of too much thyroid hormone made are Graves disease, a disease in which infection-preventing cells attack healthy cells and results in an overactive thyroid, or when one or more glandular growths make extra thyroid hormone. The most common causes of too much thyroid hormone released is thyroid inflammation, although the signs are the same as other causes. Overactive thyroid can be treated with drugs that block the formation of thyroid hormone, radiation therapy, or surgery to remove the thyroid. Radiation therapy is the most widely used treatment in the United States. The choice of treatment depends on the diagnosis, reasons not to use a particular method, how serious the overactive thyroid is, and what the patient wants.",1,B
6,16127951,"The proper treatment of hyperthyroidism depends on recognition of the signs and symptoms of the disease and determination of the etiology. The most common cause of hyperthyroidism is Graves' disease. Other common causes include thyroiditis, toxic multinodular goiter, toxic adenomas, and side effects of certain medications. The diagnostic workup begins with a thyroid-stimulating hormone level test. When test results are uncertain, measuring radionuclide uptake helps distinguish among possible causes. When thyroiditis is the cause, symptomatic treatment usually is sufficient because the associated hyperthyroidism is transient. Graves' disease, toxic multinodular goiter, and toxic adenoma can be treated with radioactive iodine, antithyroid drugs, or surgery, but in the United States, radioactive iodine is the treatment of choice in patients without contraindications. Thyroidectomy is an option when other treatments fail or are contraindicated, or when a goiter is causing compressive symptoms. Some new therapies are under investigation. Special treatment consideration must be given to patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding, as well as those with Graves' ophthalmopathy or amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism. Patients' desires must be considered when deciding on appropriate therapy, and dose monitoring is essential.","Successfully treating an overactive thyroid depends on identifying the signs and symptoms of the disease and determining the cause. Graves' disease, a disease in which infection-preventing cells attack healthy cells, is the most common cause of an overactive thyroid. Other common causes of an overactive thyroid include thyroid inflammation, one or more glandular growths making extra thyroid hormone, and side effects of some medications. A common test that measures blood levels of hormones that acts as messengers to the thyroid is the first step in a medical exam. When results of this test are uncertain, a test to measure thyroid function can be used. When the cause is inflammation of the thyroid, treating the symptoms is enough because the overactive thyroid is short-lived. Graves' disease and when one or more growths make extra thyroid hormone can be treated with radiation therapy, drugs that block the formation of thyroid hormone, or surgery. In the United States, radiation therapy to shrink the thyroid is preferred unless there is a reason not to do so. Thyroid removal is an option when other treatments do not work or should not be used, or when an enlarged thyroid is causing pressure or squeezing. New treatments are being studied. People who are pregnant or breastfeeding, and people with thyroid eye disease or overactive thyroids caused by amiodarone, a heart medication, must be given special treatment consideration. We must factor in what patients want when deciding on treatment. Maintaining a safe and effective dose is very important.",1,B
8,1000139,"The chemical structure of a neuroleptic does not relaibly predict the exact profile of its therapeutic action. We considered the question whether the biochemical action of a neuroleptic, and specifically the ratio between DA-receptor block and NA-receptor block, might have a higher predictive value in this respect. In this context we carried out a double-blind study of the therapeutic value of clozapine and perphenazine in acute psychoses of varying symptomatology and aetiology. There are strong indications that clozapine has only a slight inhibitory effect on transmission in central DA-ergic neurons, but markedly inhibits transmission in central NA-ergic neurons, and that the reverse applies to perphenazine. In view of these data we expected perphenazine to be a stronger antipsychotic and a weaker sedative than clozapine, and vice versa. The plausibility of this hypothesis was demonstrated. Partly also on the basis of earlier research, we concluded that the biochemical action of a neuroleptic is a more faithful predictor of its therapeutic action profile than the chemical structure.","The chemical structure (arrangement of chemical bonds between atoms in a molecule) of drugs used to treat psychotic disorders does not reliably predict how well the treatment works. We looked into whether the biological and chemical changes made to the body by a drug to treat psychotic disorders might better predict how well the treatment works. We did a study of how well antipsychotics clozapine and perphenazine treat short-term impaired relationships with reality with varying symptoms and causes. Data suggest that clozapine and perphenazine have opposite effects on two types of neurons or brain cells. We thought that perphenazine would be a stronger drug to treat impaired relationships with reality and a weaker sedative than clozapine, and vice versa. This assumption proved reasonable.

The total number of participants in the four trials with useful data is 313. None of the studies observed the effects of oral versus depot antipsychotic drugs. Until well conducted and reported randomised trials are undertaken clinicians will be in doubt as to the effects of perphenazine depots and people with schizophrenia should exercise their own judgement or ask to be randomised.","Drugs used to treat psychotic disorders are usually given by mouth, but it is hard to measure if people take the drugs as instructed. Slow-releasing shots, created in the 1960s, became popular as long-term treatment to keep conditions stable. Perphenazine decanoate and enanthate are slow-release shots used to treat psychotic disorders. We aimed to measure the medical, social, and economic effects of slow-releasing perphenazine decanoate and enanthate shots compared to no treatment, drugs used to treat psychotic disorders by mouth, and other slow-releasing shots used to treat psychotic disorders for people with schizophrenia (a reality-distorting mental illness). We state that slow-releasing perphenazine shots are used in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Belgium, Portugal, and the Netherlands. At least 250,000 people have schizophrenia in these countries and could be given slow-releasing perphenazine shots. The four trials with useful results had 313 total people. None of the studies compared the effects of antipsychotics taken by mouth to a slow-releasing shot. People with schizophrenia should use their own judgement until more studies are done and doctors know the effects of slow-release perphenazine shots.",1,C
8,33449568,"We have found oral perphenazine 8 mg (OP8) useful as follows: (1) as a nonsedating antiemetic; (2) as a preventative measure similar to the antihistamine promethazine against ketamine-induced psychotomimetic effects; and (3) as a safe single-dose drug (only 1.3 extrapyramidal events per 10,000 patients receiving 4–8 mg oral dose, with all events easily treated). Additionally, we evaluated the efficacy of single-dose OP8 to a single 40 mg dose of aprepitant given preoperatively in colorectal surgery patients at our academic center within an enhanced recovery protocol, which was designed to mitigate opioid utilization, reduce Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting (PONV), and optimize patient recovery. In this retrospective study, no differences were noted in antiemetic requirement on postoperative days 0 and 1 between patients receiving OP8 versus aprepitant. As enhanced recovery protocols become more widespread and continue to be applied to other surgical specialties, effective PONV prevention is imperative for improving patient outcomes. OP8 deserves to be properly evaluated (by clinical study, and/or in routine clinical practice) as a part of a cost-effective multimodal enhanced recovery strategy.","Perphenazine 8 mg (OP8) can be taken by mouth for the following uses: (1) as a nonsedating drug to prevent nausea and vomiting; (2) like promethazine, an antihistamine (allergy drug) , to prevent psychotic symptoms caused by ketamine (a pain relief drug); and (3) as a safe one-dose drug. We also rated the success of one-dose OP8 compared to one 40 mg dose of aprepitant, used to prevent nausea and vomiting, given to people before rectum, anus, and colon operations in our center with guidelines designed to help people recover more quickly from surgery, reduce opioid use, and reduce nausea and vomiting after surgery. In this study, we saw no differences in nausea and vomiting prevention on the same day of surgery and one day after surgery between patients who got OP8 versus aprepitant. As guidelines to help people recover more quickly from surgery become more widespread and used for other surgeries, successfully preventing nausea and vomiting after surgery is key to improving patient results. OP8 should be studied as part of a cost-effective, multi-process way to help people recover more quickly from surgery.",1,C
8,20739894,"Background and objective: despite the introduction of newer antiemetics in the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), perphenazine is recommended in current guidelines, as the concept of multimodal management of PONV in high-risk patients requires more than two drugs to be combined. The aim of this quantitative systematic review was to assess the efficacy and safety of perphenazine in the prophylaxis of PONV in adults and children. Results: eleven trials published between 1965 and 1999 including a total of 2081 participants fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were further analysed. In children, perphenazine 0.07 mg kg was effective in preventing vomiting (RR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.18-0.54), whereas in adults, a dose of about 5 mg was effective for the prevention of PONV (RR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.37-0.67). When compared with established newer drugs, for example, ondansetron, dexamethasone or droperidol, no significant differences were observed in the pooled analysis with limited data. Reporting of adverse events was poor. Transient sedation was reported in three eligible trials (RR, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.40-2.05).

8,24242756,"We present here a potential new treatment adjunct for glioblastoma. Building on murine studies, a series of papers appeared recently showing that therapeutic irradiation of the ipsilateral subventricular zone (SVZ) retards growth of more peripherally growing cortical glioblastomas in humans, suggesting a tumor trophic function for the SVZ. Further studies showed that SVZ cells migrate out towards a peripheral glioblastoma. Dopamine signaling through D3 subtype receptor indirectly drives this centrifugal migration in humans. Since psychiatry has several drugs with good D3 blocking attributes, such as fluphenazine, or perphenazine, we suggest that adding one of these D3 blocking drugs to current standard treatment of resection followed by temozolomide and irradiation might prolong survival by depriving glioblastoma of the trophic functions previously subserved by dopaminergic signaling on SVZ cells.","We look at a possible new treatment to add to standard treatment for glioblastoma, a type of brain cancer. Based on mouse studies, several recent studies showed that radiation of the part of the brain where brain cells are made reduces growth of some glioblastomas in humans, suggesting this part of the brain might play a role in fueling brain tumors. More studies showed cells from the part of the brain where brain cells are made move outward toward a glioblastoma. Certain molecule signaling causes this cell movement. Because many mental health drugs block molecule signaling, such as fluphenazine, or perphenazine, we suggest adding one of these drugs to the current standard treatment of surgery followed by chemotherapy and radiation to possibly increase survival time by cutting off fuel to the glioblastoma.",1,C

The flexible panendoscope was used 211 times (87.2%) to manage these foreign bodies, while the rigid esophagoscope was used 12 times (5.0%). Two hundred thirty-nine foreign bodies (98.8%) were successfully managed endoscopically. The surgery rate was 0.4%. There was no morbidity or mortality. Twenty-five percent of the cases were done under general endotracheal anesthesia. Coins in the esophagus are removed promptly if in the cervical or mid esophagus, and within 12 hours if in the distal esophagus. Once in the stomach, they will usually pass without difficulty. Meat impaction resulting in an obstructed esophagus is an urgent problem and the bolus should be removed within hours. Sharp and pointed foreign bodies can be very difficult to manage. Dry runs with a reproduction of the foreign body are essential to successful removal. Button batteries lodged in the esophagus represent an emergency and should be removed without delay.

9,33448766,"Dysphagia is common but may be underreported. Specific symptoms, rather than their perceived location, should guide the initial evaluation and imaging. Obstructive symptoms that seem to originate in the throat or neck may actually be caused by distal esophageal lesions. Oropharyngeal dysphagia manifests as difficulty initiating swallowing, coughing, choking, or aspiration, and it is most commonly caused by chronic neurologic conditions such as stroke, Parkinson disease, or dementia. Symptoms should be thoroughly evaluated because of the risk of aspiration. Patients with esophageal dysphagia may report a sensation of food getting stuck after swallowing. This condition is most commonly caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease and functional esophageal disorders. Eosinophilic esophagitis is triggered by food allergens and is increasingly prevalent; esophageal biopsies should be performed to make the diagnosis. Esophageal motility disorders such as achalasia are relatively rare and may be overdiagnosed. Opioid-induced esophageal dysfunction is becoming more common. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy is recommended for the initial evaluation of esophageal dysphagia, with barium esophagography as an adjunct. Esophageal cancer and other serious conditions have a low prevalence, and testing in low-risk patients may be deferred while a four-week trial of acid-suppressing therapy is undertaken. Many frail older adults with progressive neurologic disease have significant but unrecognized dysphagia, which significantly increases their risk of aspiration pneumonia and malnourishment. In these patients, the diagnosis of dysphagia should prompt a discussion about goals of care before potentially harmful interventions are considered. Speech-language pathologists and other specialists, in collaboration with family physicians, can provide structured assessments and make appropriate recommendations for safe swallowing, palliative care, or rehabilitation.","Trouble swallowing is common but may be underreported. Specific symptoms, not the area where they are thought to come from, should guide the first exam and visual tests. Symptoms of difficulty breathing that seem to come from the throat or neck may actually be caused by damage in the lower esophagus. Difficulty swallowing that happens in the mouth or the throat shows up as difficulty starting swallowing, coughing, choking, or something entering the airway or lungs by accident. It is most often caused by long-term brain conditions such as stroke, Parkinson's, or memory, language, and thinking loss. Symptoms should be looked at closely due to the risk of something entering the airway or lungs by accident. People with problems that happen during swallowing may describe a feeling of food getting stuck after swallowing. Problems that happen during swallowing is most often caused by stomach-related reflux diseases and disorders of the esophagus with symptoms like heartburn and chest pain. A long-term allergic condition of the esophagus is set off by food allergens and is more and more common. To diagnose this condition, a small part of the esophagus should be removed for examination. Dysfunction of the esophagus that causes difficulty swallowing such as a disorder in which your esophagus is unable to move food and liquids down into your stomach are pretty rare and may be overdiagnosed. Dysfunction of the esophagus caused by opioids is becoming more common. Using a flexible tube with a camera to look at the esophagus, stomach and part of the small intestine is used to look at difficulty swallowing that happens in the mouth and throat, together with barium and X-rays. Cancer of the esophagus and other serious conditions are not common, and low-risk people may take acid reducers for 4 weeks before undergoing testing. Many weak older adults with progressive deterioration in functioning have serious but unseen difficulty swallowing, which really increases their risk of pneumonia (lung infection) caused by something entering the airway or lungs by accident and risk of lacking nutrients in the body. In these people, the diagnosis of difficulty breathing should lead to a conversation about what is important to the person before suggesting possibly harmful treatments.

Measuring the strength and muscle coordination of your esophagus when you swallow led to the finding of 3 subtypes of achalasia that have different pressure and contraction patterns. A lot of saliva and puckering where the esophagus is connected to the stomach, seen using a flexible tube with a camera, or a widened esophagus and narrowing where the esophagus is connected to the stomach, that looks like a bird's beak, found by X-raying the esophagus suggest achalasia. In this guideline, we used a popular method to guide doctors on how best to diagnose and treat people with achalasia.",1,C
9,25328387,"Objective: In the present study, an attempt was made to examine the effects of aural stimulation with ointment containing capsaicin on swallowing function in order to develop a novel and safe treatment for non-obstructive dysphagia in elderly patients. Patients and methods: The present study included 26 elderly patients with non-obstructive dysphagia. Ointment containing 0.025% capsaicin (0.5 g) was applied to the external auditory canal with a cotton swab under otoscope only once or once a day for 7 days before swallowing of a bolus of colored water (3 mL), which was recorded by transnasal videoendoscopy and evaluated according to the endoscopic swallowing score. Results: After a single application of 0.025% capsaicin ointment to the right external auditory canal, the endoscopic swallowing score was significantly decreased, and this effect lasted for 60 minutes. After repeated applications of the ointment to each external auditory canal alternatively once a day for 7 days, the endoscopic swallowing score decreased significantly in patients with more severe non-obstructive dysphagia. Of the eight tube-fed patients of this group, three began direct swallowing exercises using jelly, which subsequently restored their oral food intake. Conclusion: These findings suggest that stimulation of the external auditory canal with ointment containing capsaicin improves swallowing function in elderly patients with non-obstructive dysphagia. By the same mechanism used by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors to induce cough reflex, which has been shown to prevent aspiration pneumonia, aural stimulation with capsaicin may reduce the incidence of aspiration pneumonia in dysphagia patients via Arnold's ear-cough reflex stimulation.","We looked at the effects of rubbing an ointment with capsaicin, found in different types of hot peppers, on the ears to improve swallowing function and create a new and safe treatment for old people who have the sensation of food stuck in the esophagus without physical blockage. We looked at 26 old people who had the sensation of food stuck in the esophagus without physical blockage. We used a Q-tip to put ointment with 0.025% capsaicin (0.5 g) in the ear only once or once a day for 7 days before drinking 3 mL of colored water, which was recorded using a flexible tube with a camera and rated using a common test that measures how well one swallows. After putting 0.025% capsaicin ointment to the right ear, the common swallowing test showed less difficulty swallowing. This effect lasted for one hour. After putting the ointment on alternating ears once a day for 7 days, the common swallowing test showed less difficulty swallowing in people with more serious sensations of food stuck in the esophagus without physical blockage. Of the eight people fed with tubes in this group, three began direct swallowing exercises using jelly, which then returned their ability to eat food by mouth. We concluded that putting ointment with capsaicin on the ear improves swallowing function in old people who have the sensation of food stuck in the esophagus without physical blockage. In the same way as other methods to stimulate the cough reflex, putting capsaicin on the ears may decrease how often people with difficulty swallowing develop pneumonia, caused by something entering the airway or lungs by accident, through a cough reflex stimulated by a nerve.",1,C
10,3068693,"The local, systemic, and referred causes of finger pain are generally recognizable by historical features and physical examination findings, although radiographs and laboratory evaluation are often required to support the diagnostic impression. Most minor traumatic causes of finger pain require only conservative management, including immobilization followed by exercise. Infectious causes of finger pain include cellulitis, tendinitis, paronychia, felon, and infectious emboli, which generally require antibiotics with or without drainage. Certain patients with finger pain resulting from infection should be referred to a hand surgeon. Vascular and ischemic causes of finger pain represent true emergencies, because tissue viability is dependent on prompt intervention. Whereas any sensory neuropathy may present with finger pain, carpal tunnel syndrome is among the most common. Systemic rheumatic disease, such as rheumatoid arthritis or vasculitis, may begin with finger pain. In addition, such pain may be the first manifestation of a serious systemic illness, as in hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy. Reflex sympathetic dystrophy is an example of referred pain, presumably by way of neural mechanisms. Certain infectious, traumatic, and ischemic causes of finger pain must be diagnosed promptly to avoid significant morbidity; depending upon the cause of the symptoms, referral to a hand surgeon, rheumatologist, or neurologist may be appropriate. Symptomatic and functional improvement may also be hastened by the input of an occupational therapist.","The causes of finger pain can usually be found by learning about the duration and severity of the problem and doing a physical examination. However, x-rays and lab tests are often used to identify the cause of the pain. Most minor traumatic injuries that cause finger pain only need non-invasive (no surgery) therapy, such as resting followed by exercise. Finger pain caused by an infection (germs that build in the body causing illness) usually require medicines that fight bacteria called antibiotics. A process called drainage that removes extra fluid from a wound is sometimes used with antibiotics. Sometimes patients with finger pain from an infection will see a hand surgeon. Limited or no blood flow to or through the tissues in the finger can cause finger pain, are signs of a true emergency, and require immediate attention to prevent more damage to the tissues. Patients with nerve damage may have finger pain. Carpal tunnel syndrome (pain or tingling in the hand or arm caused by a pinched wrist nerve) is a common example of pain caused by nerve damage. Diseases that can cause your immune system to attack your joints, muscles, bones and organs (called systemic rheumatic diseases) can begin with finger pain. In addition, finger pain may be the first sign of a more serious illness, such as in hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy (a rare disease with irritation around the bone and enlarged fingertips). Reflex sympathetic dystrophy (a disease causing long-lasting pain in one or more limbs) is an example of when an injury in one part to the body causes pain in a different part of the body. Certain infections, traumatic injuries, and blood flow problems that cause finger pain must be identified quickly to prevent long-term or more serious damage. In some cases, going to a hand surgeon, a rheumatologist (doctor who treats arthritis and other joint, muscle, and bone diseases), or a neurologist (brain and nerve doctor) is needed. Progress in reducing pain and improving movement in the finger may come faster with the help of an occupational therapist, people who help patients with injuries, illnesses, and disabilities build or restore their abilities to do everyday tasks in life.",1,C

However, radiographs (images created usually by x-rays) and other lab tests are usually required to support the identification. Most minor causes of finger pain need only mild treatment, like restraining the finger from moving and exercise. Causes of finger pain from bacteria include cellulitis (a bacterial skin infection), tendinitis (an irritation of the tendon), paronychia (a bacterial nail infection), felon (a bacterial fingertip infection), and emboli (a blood vessel blockage). These causes generally require antibacterials alomg with or without fluid drainage of the finger. Some patients with finger pain from bacteria should be sent to a hand surgeon. Causes of finger pain related to blood vessels represent real emergencies that depend on quick treatment. When any nerve damage leads to finger pain, a pinched nerve in the wrist is usually the most common. Full-body autoimmune diseases (diseases in which infection-preventing cells attack healthy cells), which may cause joint pain or irritation in the blood vessels, might start with finger pain. Also, finger pain may be the first sign of a serious full-body illness, as in hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy, a rare disease with irritation around the bone and joints and enlarged fingertips. Reflex sympathetic dystrophy (a disease causing long-lasting limb pain) is an example of pain felt in an area away from its source, possibly by nerve signaling issues. Some bacteria-related, injury-related, and blood vessel-related causes of finger pain must be checked quickly to avoid serious harm. Depending on the cause, help from a hand surgeon, rheumatologist (a doctor who treats musculoskeletal issues), or neurologist (a doctor who treats nerve-related issues) may be needed.

10,29184745,"When patients present with acute or chronic hand and/or finger pain after an injury, try placing a pencil first over and then under the proximal phalanx of the finger that is generating the pain. Ask the patient to flex and extend the fingers several times. Putting the affected metacarpal phalangeal (MP) joint more relatively flexed or extended than the other MP joints will often take away the pain with active movement with the pencil in place. When this happens, our hand therapist builds a relative motion splint that simulates the effect of the pencil. These are very functional splints that patients wear 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Most people can work with these splints on.","When a patient has sudden or ongoing hand and/or finger pain after an injury, a hand therapist may place a pencil over and under the first bone of the finger (that starts at the base from the hand) that is causing the pain. The doctor will then ask the patient to flex and extend the fingers several times. Putting the first knuckle (the joint where the finger connects with the hand) in a more flexed and extended position than the other knuckles will often take away the pain with active movement when the pencil is in place. The hand therapist will then build a relative motion splint (a piece of sturdy material to support injured bones and allow some movement) that will have the same effect of the pencil. These types of splints support initial movement and can be worn 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Most people can work with these splints on.",1,C
10,21493175,"Objective: To identify through case study the presentation and possible pathophysiological cause of complex regional pain syndrome and its preferential response to stellate ganglion blockade. Setting: Complex regional pain syndrome can occur in an extremity after minor injury, fracture, surgery, peripheral nerve insult or spontaneously and is characterised by spontaneous pain, changes in skin temperature and colour, oedema, and motor disturbances. Pathophysiology is likely to involve peripheral and central components and neurological and inflammatory elements. There is no consistent approach to treatment with a wide variety of specialists involved. Diagnosis can be difficult, with over-diagnosis resulting from undue emphasis placed upon pain disproportionate to an inciting event despite the absence of other symptoms or under-diagnosed when subtle symptoms are not recognised. The International Association for the Study of Pain supports the use of sympathetic blocks to reduce sympathetic nervous system overactivity and relieve complex regional pain symptoms. Educational reviews promote stellate ganglion blockade as beneficial. Three blocks were given at 8, 10 and 13 months after the initial injury under local anaesthesia and sterile conditions. Physiotherapeutic input was delivered under block conditions to maximise joint and tissue mobility and facilitate restoration of function. Conclusion: This case demonstrates the need for practitioners from all disciplines to be able to identify the clinical characteristics of complex regional pain syndrome to instigate immediate treatment and supports the notion that stellate ganglion blockade is preferable to upper limb intravenous regional anaesthetic block for refractory index finger pain associated with complex regional pain syndrome.","The objective of this case report (a summary of an individual patient's symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment) is to identify the sign or symptoms and causes of complex regional pain syndrome (a form of ongoing pain that affects the arm or leg) and if a pain treatment called stellate ganglion blockade (an injection of medication into nerves at the front of the neck that can relieve pain) has any effect on the pain. Complex regional pain syndrome can occur in the arms or legs after a minor injury, fracture, surgery, or nerve damage. It appears as sudden, random pain, changes in skin temperatures and color, swelling in ankles, feet or legs, and uncontrollable movements in the body. Disease-related physical changes are likely to involve outer and central parts, nerve-related elements, and inflammatory elements, the body's natural response to injury or infection. There is no consistent approach to treatment with a wide variety of specialists involved. Diagnosis can be difficult. Sometimes it is over-diagnosed (diagnosis of a medical condition that would never have caused any symptoms or problems) from too much attention on the pain even though other symptoms are not present. Sometimes it can be under-diagnosed (diagnosed less often than its occurrence) when less obvious symptioms are not recognized. A professional medical association for the study of pain supports the kind of pain block used in stellate ganglion blockade to reduce sensory nerves and relieve pain sympoms. Educational reviews promote stellate ganglion blockade as beneficial. Three blocks (injections) were given at 8, 10 and 13 months after the initial injury under local anaesthesia and clean conditions. Physical therapy was provided after the patient received an injection to allow more movement of the joint and tissues and to help restore use of the injured finger. This case shows that healthcare providers need to be able to identify clinical signs of complex regional pain syndrome to start treatment immediately. It also shows that stellate ganglion blockade is a preferable method to an IV of local anaesthetic (one-time injection of medicine that numbs a small area of the body) in the upper arm to help finger pain associated with complex regional pain syndrome.",1,C

The purpose of the present study was to assess the effectiveness of LLLT for chronic joint pain of the elbow, wrist, and fingers. Subjects and methods: Nine male and 15 female patients with chronic joint pain of the elbow, wrist, or fingers, who were treated at the rehabilitation outpatient clinic at our hospital from April, 2007 to March, 2009 were enrolled in the study. We used a 1000 mW semiconductor laser device. Each tender point and three points around it were irradiated with laser energy. Each point was irradiated twice for 20 s per treatment, giving a total of three minutes for all 4 points. Patients visited the clinic twice a week, and were evaluated after four weeks of treatment. Pain was evaluated with a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Statistical analysis of the VAS scores after laser irradiation was performed with Wilcoxon's signed rank sum test, using SPSS Ver.17. Results: All VAS scores were totaled and statistically analyzed. The average VAS score before irradiation was 59.2±12.9, and 33.1±12.2 after the irradiation, showing a significant improvement in VAS score (p<0.001) after treatment. The treatment effect lasted for about one and a half days in the case of wrist pain, epicondylitis lateralis (tennis elbow), and carpal tunnel syndrome. In other pain entities, it lasted for about three to fifteen hours. No change in the range of motion (ROM) was seen in any of the 24 subjects.

The study analyzed VAS scores (how patients described their pain) after they received the LLLT laser treatment. All VAS scores that document pain intensity were totaled and analyzed. There was significant improvement in how much pain patients felt after they received the treatment. The effect of the laser treatment lasted for about one and half days for patients with wrist pain, tennis elbow, and carpal tunnel syndrome (pinched nerve in the wrist). In patients with other types of pain, the effect lasted for about 3-15 hours. There was no change in how far patients could move or stretch the injured part of the body after the treatment.

10,32100225,"This compilation presents a comprehensive review of the literature on common chronic pain conditions of the hand. It briefly presents these common conditions with their biological background, diagnosis, and common management options. It then presents and compares the latest literature available for injection techniques to treat these diagnoses and compares the available evidence. Results: Hand pain is a common condition with 9.7% prevalence in men and 21.6% in women and can cause significant morbidity and disability. It also carries a significant cost to the individuals and the healthcare system, totaling in $4 billion dollars in 2003. Injection therapy is an alternative when conservative treatment fails. Osteoarthritis is the most common chronic hand pain syndrome and affects about 16% of the population. Its mechanism is largely mechanic, and as such, there is controversy if steroid injections are of benefit. Hyaluronic acid (HA) appears to provide substantial relief of pain and may increase functionality. More studies of HA are required to make a definite judgment on its efficacy. Similarly, steroid ganglion cyst injection may confer little benefit. Carpal tunnel syndrome is a compressive neuropathy, and only temporarily relieved with injection therapy. US-guidance provides significant improvement and, while severe cases may still require surgery, can provide a valuable bridge therapy to surgery when conservative treatment fails. Similar bridging treatments and increased efficacy under US-guidance are effective for stenosing tenosynovitis (""trigger finger""), though, interestingly, inflammatory background is associated with decreased effect in this case. When the etiology of the pain is inflammatory, such as in RA, corticosteroid (CS) injections provide significant pain relief and increased functionality. They do not, however, change the course of disease (unlike DMARDs). Another such example is De-Quervain tenosynovitis that sees good benefit from CS injections, and an increased efficacy with US-guidance, and similarly are CS injections for gout. For Raynaud's phenomenon, Botox injections have encouraging results, but more studies are needed to determine safety and efficacy, as well as the possible difference in effect between primary and secondary Raynaud's. Conclusions: Chronic hand pain is a prevalent and serious condition and can cause significant morbidity and disability and interferes with independence and activities of daily living. Conservative treatment remains the first line of treatment; however, when first-line treatments fail, steroid injections can usually provide benefit. In some cases, Hyaluronic acid or Botox may also be beneficial. US-guidance is increasing in hand injection and almost ubiquitously provides safer, more effective injections. Hand surgery remains the alternative for refractory pain.","This report presents a thorough review of the literature on common chronic pain conditions of the hand.

The report also shows and compares the latest literature available for injection methods to treat these diagnoses and compares the available evidence. Hand pain is a common condition occuring in 9.7% of men and 21.6% of women and can cause significant illness and disability. It is also costly to the individuals and the healthcare system, totaling in $4 billion dollars in 2003. Injection therapy (a treatment that involves inserting a needle into the skin to deliver medicine and reduce pain) is an option when other non-surgical treatments fail. Osteoarthritis (the wearing down of flexible tissue at the end of bones) is the most common chronic hand pain condition and affects about 16% of the population. There is disagreement on whether steroid injections are helpful to osteoarthritis. Injections of hyaluronic acid (a natural lubricant that can relieve pain) appear to provide significant relief of pain and may increase movement. More studies of hyaluronic acid are required before deciding how well it works. Similarly, steroid injection to reduce a ganglion cyst (a swelling or bump on the wrist joint) may have little benefit. Injection therapy provides only short-term relief for carpal tunnel syndrome (pinched nerves in the wrist). While severe cases of hand pain may still require surgery, injection therapy may be an additional treatment step before surgery. Similar treatments under US-guidance are effective for a condition called trigger finger where the finger gets locked in a bent position. When the cause of the pain is inflammation (the body's response to injury or infection often causing swelling, pain, or redness), corticosteroid or steroid injections provide significant pain relief and increased movement. Corticosteroid injections do not, however, change the course of disease. Other conditions such as gout (a type of arthritis that causes sudden pain or swelling, often in the big toe) and De-Quervain tenosynovitis (pain in the tendons in the thumb) may get some benefit from corticosteroid injections. Botox injections show encouraging results for Raynaud's phenomenon (spasms caused by slow blood flow in the fingers and other extremities), but more studies are needed to determine safety and how well the injections work. Chronic hand pain is a common and serious condition, can cause significant illness and disability, and interferes with independence and the activities of daily living. Careful, non-invasive treatment remains the first line of treatment; however, when first-line treatments fail, steroid injections can usually provide benefit. In some cases, Hyaluronic acid or Botox may also be helpful. US-guidance is expanding in hand injections and provides safer, more effective injections.

10,30328699,"Background: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by pain, functional disability, poor quality of life (QoL), high socioeconomic impact, and annual costs of over $56 billion in the United States. Acupuncture (AC) is widely in use; however, studies show severe methodological shortcomings, did not consider the functional diagnosis for the allocation of acupoints and their results showed no differences between verum and control groups. Objective: The authors aimed to objectively assess the safety and efficacy of AC treatments for RA. Methods: 105 RA patients with a functional diagnosis of a ""Pivot syndrome"" or ""Turning Point syndrome"" were randomly assigned to (1) verum-AC (verum acupoints), (2) control-AC (sham acupoints-points outside of the conduits/meridians and of the extra-conduits), or (3) waiting list (each group n = 35). AC groups experienced the exact same number, depth, and stimulation of needles. Assessments took place before and 5 min after AC with follow-ups over 4 weeks. Results: (1) Verum-AC significantly improved self-reported pain (Z = -5.099, p < 0.001) and pressure algometry (Z = -5.086, p < 0.001); hand grip strength (Z = -5.086, p < 0.001) and arm strength (Z = -5.086, p < 0.001); health status improved significantly (p < 0.001, Z = -4.895); QoL improved significantly in 7/8 survey domains; and number of swollen joints (Z = -2.862, p = 0.004) and tender joints (Z = -3.986, p < 0.001) significantly decreased. (2) Control-AC showed no significant changes, except in self-reported pain improvement. (3) Waiting list group showed an overall worsening. Conclusion: This is the first double-blind controlled study on AC in RA of the hand that objectively and specifically assesses positive effects supporting its integration in rheumatology. Acupoint allocation according to Chinese Medicine functional diagnoses is extremely relevant to assess AC effectiveness in a patient group primarily defined by a ""western"" medicine diagnosis. Based on clear allocation criteria for acupoints, the authors minimized the possible bias of unspecific and suggestive effects on the control group, showed the specific effects of the points chosen, improved efficacy, and identified an evidence base for AC.","Rheumatoid arthritis is a disease where the immune system attacks healthy cells in the body by mistake. It can cause pain, decrease movement, lead to poor quality of life, impact the social and economic parts of communities, and cost over $56 billion in the United States every year. Acupuncture involves pricking the skin or tissues with thin needles at key points in the body to reduce pain and is widely used. However, studies show problems in the methods used to measure acupuncture. The aim of this current study is to evaluate the safety and the performance of acupuncture treatments on rheumatoid arthritis. In this study, 105 patients with rheumatoid arthritis and a specific diagnosis were randomly assigned to either the acupuncture group, the sham acupuncture group (where the patient is pricked with thin needles but at different, less key points of the body), or a waiting list group. Each group had 35 patients. The acupuncture groups (both normal and sham) experienced the exact same number, depth, and stimulation of needles. A physical and visual exam of patients took place before and 5 minutes after acupuncture treatment with follow-up visits over 4 weeks. Patients in the acupuncture group showed signficantly improved pain and pain sensitivity, hand grip and arm strength, as well as improved health status. Quality of life significantly improved in 7 out of 8 parts of a survey. The number of swollen joints and tender joints signficantly decreased. In the sham acupuncture group (the group that received needle pricks but outside the key points of the body) did not have any significant changes in their condition except in pain improvement. The waiting list group showed an overall worsening. This is the first double-blind controlled study (where neither the patients nor the researcher knows which treatment participants are getting) on acupuncture for rheumatoid arthritis of the hand. The study shows positive effects supporting acupuncture's inclusion in other treatments for rheumatology (diseases in the joints, muscles, tendons, ligaments). The site of the acupuncture needle is very important to determine acupuncture effectiveness. Because the authors in this study clearly defined the placement of the acupuncture needles on the body, they reduced possible bias, showed how the placement of the needles affects the body, improved performance of acupuncture, and identified evidence to support use of acupuncture.",1,C

This syndrome and the pain, numbness, tingling, and weakness in your hand that result from it are caused by pressure on the median nerve as it travels through the carpal tunnel. Guidelines published in the May 2019 issue of JOSPT make recommendations, based on best practices from the published literature, for evaluating, diagnosing, and treating carpal tunnel syndrome. For you as a patient, these guidelines outline the best rehabilitation treatment options based on the scientific research. Ultimately, the best care is a combination of the leading science, the clinical expertise of your health care provider, and your input as the patient. These guidelines help inform the first step in that process. Practical Advice: Physical therapists are well trained to assess and evaluate people with carpal tunnel syndrome. Although some patients (anywhere from 28% to 62%) recover without treatment, others (from 32% to 58%) get worse. A key to nonsurgical treatment shown to help those with carpal tunnel syndrome is the use of a night brace; a night brace should hold your wrist in a neutral position and only be worn for short-term symptom relief. If you have mild to moderate carpal tunnel syndrome, stretching exercises and the night brace can help, as can manual therapy of your cervical spine and upper extremity performed by a therapist. Education on the proper setup of your computer, especially the mouse, and how hard you strike the keyboard may also help control your symptoms of pain and loss of feeling. The literature review for these guidelines found that low-level laser therapy, thermal ultrasound, iontophoresis, and magnets provided no consistent benefit in treating carpal tunnel syndrome. If nonsurgical treatment does not help, you may need surgery. Your physical therapist can help guide your recovery, decreasing your symptoms.","Pain and a loss of feeling in the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and part of the ring finger may be a sign of carpal tunnel syndrome (pinched nerves in the wrist). This syndrome and the pain, numbness, tingling, and weakness in the hand is caused by pressure on the main nerve at the front of the forearm as it travels through the carpal tunnel, a narrow passageway at the base of the hand that is made of ligaments and bone. Guidelines from the May 2019 issue of Journal of Orthopaedic & Sports Physical Therapy, a scientific journal, make recommendations for evaluating, diagnosing, and treating carpal tunnel syndrome. For patients, these guidelines outline the best rehabilitation treatment options (care that can help people regain, keep, or improve abilities needed for daily life) based on the scientific research.

Design: Randomized controlled trial. Setting: Outpatient clinic. Participants: Fifty-two women with symptomatic OA and presence of Heberden's and Bouchard's nodes, allocated randomly to the intervention group or the control group. Intervention: The intervention group used a nighttime orthosis on the second or third finger of the dominant hand. Both groups participated in an educational session. Outcomes and measures: The following parameters were measured: pain (numerical rating scale, Australian/Canadian Osteoarthritis Hand Index), grip and pinch strength, function (Cochin Hand Functional Scale), and manual performance (Moberg Pick Up Test). Results: The intervention group showed a statistically significant improvement in pain (p < .001) and hand function. The improvement in pain correlated with Cochin Hand Functional Scale scores and the absence of Bouchard's nodes in the third finger, which are predictors of the best prognosis for treatment with a nighttime orthosis.

11,32073132,"The main source of energy for brain and other organs is glucose. To obtain energy for all tissue, glucose has to come through glycolysis; then as pyruvate it is converted to acetyl-CoA by pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) and finally enters citric acid cycle. What happens when one of these stages become disturb? Mutation in genes encoding subunits of PDC leads to pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency. Abnormalities in PDC activity result in severe metabolic and brain malformations. For better understanding the development and mechanism of pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency the murine model of this disease has been created. Studies on a murine model showed similar malformation in brain structures as in the patients suffered from pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency such as reduced neuronal density, heterotopias of grey matter, reduced size of corpus callosum and pyramids. There is still no effective cure for PDC-deficiency. Promising therapy seemed to be ketogenic diet, which substitutes glucose to ketone bodies as a source of energy. Studies have shown that ketogenic diet decreases lactic acidosis and inhibits brain malformations, but not the mortality in early childhood. The newest reports say that phenylbutyrate increases the level of PDC in the brain, because it reduces the level of inactive form of PDH. Experiments on human fibroblast and zebra fish PDC-deficiency model showed that phenylbutyrate is promising cure to PDC-deficiency. This review summarizes the most important findings on the metabolic and morphological effects of PDC-deficiency and research for treatment therapy.","The main source of energy for the brain and other organs is glucose, a type of sugar in the blood that comes from the food people eat. In order for energy to reach all tissues, glucose has to go through a process with several stages. One of these stages is called pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) which converts molecules and links cells to the final stage of creating energy. What happens when one of these stages is disturbed? Genetic changes in the PDC process leads to pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency, a disease where the body cannot properly breakdown food to create fuel or energy. Errors in PDC (pyruvate dehydrogenase complex) activity also result in severe disruption of the body's ability to process and distribute nutrients and can create brain malformations where the brain or nervous system is damaged or has not formed properly during pregnancy. To better understand the pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency, researchers created an experiment that includes common household rats and mice. Studies using an animal experiment showed similar abnormalities in brain structures compared to patients suffering from pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency. There is still no effective cure for pyruvate dehydrogenase complex-deficiency. Promising therapy may be a low carb, high fat diet called a ketogenic diet, where the body substitutes glucose with ketone bodies (chemicals the body makes when there is not enough glucose) as a source of energy. Studies show that a ketogenic diet decreases lactic acidosis (lactic acid build up that can cause nausea, vomiting, and breathing problems) and slows down brain malformations, but not death in early childhood. The newest reports say that phenylbutyrate, a type of salt in the body that helps remove ammonia and waste from the body, increases the level of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex in the brain.

Methods: Pediatric patients diagnosed with pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency in Sweden and treated with ketogenic diet were evaluated. Study assessments at specific time points included developmental and neurocognitive testing, patient log books, and investigator and parental questionnaires. A systematic literature review was also performed. Results: Nineteen patients were assessed, the majority having prenatal disease onset. Patients were treated with ketogenic diet for a median of 2.9 years. All patients alive at the time of data registration at a median age of 6 years. The treatment had a positive effect mainly in the areas of epilepsy, ataxia, sleep disturbance, speech/language development, social functioning, and frequency of hospitalizations. It was also safe-except in one patient who discontinued because of acute pancreatitis. The median plasma concentration of ketone bodies (3-hydroxybutyric acid) was 3.3 mmol/l. Poor dietary compliance was associated with relapsing ataxia and stagnation of motor and neurocognitive development. Results of neurocognitive testing are reported for 12 of 19 patients. Conclusion: Ketogenic diet was an effective and safe treatment for the majority of patients. Treatment effect was mainly determined by disease phenotype and attainment and maintenance of ketosis.","A ketogenic diet is a low carb, high-fat diet that can help create fuel for the body when glucose levels are low.

The effects of a ketogenic diet on the body's chemical process to turn food into energy and potential safety issues are also studied. Child patients diagnosed with pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency in Sweden and treated with a ketogenic diet are evaluated in this study. The study includes different tests on development and brain function, recording assessments in patient log books, and a series of questions for both researchers and parents to answer. A review of all relevant research on this topic is also performed. Nineteen patients were included in the study. For most of the patients, the disease developed during pregnancy. Patients were treated with ketogenic diet for about 2.9 years, but this time varied. All patients alive at the time of data registration were about 6 years old, but the age did vary. The treatment has a positive effect mainly in the areas of epilepsy (a disorder that causes seizures), ataxia (loss of control of movement), sleep disturbance, speech/language development, social functioning (the ability to engage with others), and the number of hospitalizations. It is also safe-except in one patient who had to stop because of acute pancreatitis, where the pancreas becomes swollen over a short period of time. Not staying on the diet regularly is connected with returning ataxia (loss of control of movement) and slowing or stopping of the strengthening of bones and muscles and brain development. Ketogenic diet is an effective and safe treatment for the majority of patients. How effective treatment is was mostly determined by physical traits or characteristics of patients and by if the body reaches and maintains ketosis, a process where the body burns stored fat for energy instead of glucose.",1,B

After stabilisation and a period of compulsory fasting, subsequent feeding with PediaSure® resulted in the recurrence of lactic acidosis. A metabolic workup revealed an elevated serum pyruvate level. Brain MRI was normal. Skeletal muscle biopsy confirmed PDCD. The most common cause of PDCD is a mutation in the X-linked PDHA1 gene. The severity of PDCD can range from neonatal death to more delayed onset of symptoms as in our index case. Normal brain MRI is reported in only 2% of patients with PDCD. There is no effective treatment for PDCD. In patients with proximal muscle weakness and feeding intolerance with glucose-containing feeds, the presence of lactic acidosis should raise the suspicion of PDCD irrespective of the patient's age and normal MRI.","Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency (PDCD) or shortage is a rare disorder that can impact metabolism and lead to problems in the brain and nerves. Structural brain abnormalities are common in PDCD. A case of a patient with PDCD is described. A 20-month-old boy with hypotonia (low muscle tone) and developmental delay, was seen by doctors and also had hypoxia (low levels of oxygen in tissues) and trouble breathing due to bronchiolitis (a lung infection). While in the hospital, he was prescribed PediaSure® feeds, a child formula or nutritional food product. Two days after starting these feeds, he stopped breathing and needed a tube inserted in his throat to help him breathe. After being stable and fasting (no food or drinks), feeding with PediaSure® resulted in the recurrence of lactic acidosis (lactic acid build up that can cause nausea, vomiting, and breathing problem). The MRI (scanned image) of the brain was normal. Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency (PDCD) was confirmed by viewing the muscle tissue under a microscope. The most common cause of PDCD is a mutation in one of the genes called PDHA1 (a gene that encodes a building block of PCD). The seriousness of PDCD can range from infant death to more delayed onset of symptoms as in the child case described here. A normal brain MRI is reported in only 2% of patients with PDCD. There is no effective treatment for PDCD. In patients with muscle weakness and who are unable to eat foods with glucose, the presence of lactic acidosis should raise the suspicion of PDCD regardless of the patient's age and normal MRI.",1,B

A common feature of these disorders is impaired bioenergetics, which through incompletely defined mechanisms result in a wide spectrum of neurological symptoms, such as epileptic seizures, developmental delay, and movement disorders. The ketogenic diet (KD) has been successfully utilized to treat such conditions to varying degrees. While the mechanisms underlying the clinical efficacy of the KD in IEM remain unclear, it is likely that the proposed heterogeneous targets influenced by the KD work in concert to rectify or ameliorate the downstream negative consequences of genetic mutations affecting key metabolic enzymes and substrates-such as oxidative stress and cell death. These beneficial effects can be broadly grouped into restoration of impaired bioenergetics and synaptic dysfunction, improved redox homeostasis, anti-inflammatory, and epigenetic activity. Hence, it is conceivable that the KD might prove useful in other metabolic disorders that present with epileptic seizures. At the same time, however, there are notable contraindications to KD use, such as fatty acid oxidation disorders.

These disorders commonly include weakened energy-monitoring processes, which lead to a range of nerve-related effects, including epileptic seizures, growth delay, and movement disorders. The ketogenic diet (KD) (a low-carb diet) has successfully treated these conditions to some effect.

Cells were transduced with scAAV vectors containing the cytomegalovirus promoter-driven enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) reporter gene at a vector:cell ratio of 200. Transgene expression was measured 72h later. The transduction efficiency of scAAV2 and scAAV6 vectors was 3- to 5-fold higher than that of the other serotypes, which were subsequently used to transduce fibroblasts with wild-type PDHA1 cDNA under the control of the chicken beta-action (CBA) promoter at a vector:cell ratio of 1000. Total PDH-specific activity and E1alpha protein expression were determined 10 days post-transduction. Both vectors increased E1alpha expression 40-60% in both control and patient cells, and increased PDH activity in two patient cell lines. We also used dichloroacetate (DCA) to maximally activate PDH through dephosphorylation of E1alpha. Exposure for 24h to 5mM DCA increased PDH activity in non-transduced control (mean 37% increase) and PDH deficient (mean 44% increase) cells. Exposure of transduced patient fibroblasts to DCA increased PDH activity up to 90% of the activity measured in untreated control cells. DCA also increased expression of E1alpha protein and, to variable extents, that of other components of the PDH complex in both non-transduced and transduced cells. These data suggest that a combined gene delivery and pharmacological approach may hold promise for the treatment of PDH deficiency.","This study focuses on the ability of self-complementary adeno-associated virus (scAAV) vectors (a gene therapy tool that introduces genetic material using a modified virus to create a normal copy of a damaged gene) to deliver the pyruvate dehydrogenase gene called PDHA1 (a gene involved in the chemical process to create energy for the body) and create proteins. Cell samples of connective tissue from 3 patients with mutations in PDHA1 and 3 healthy patients were collected for the gene therapy process. Cells are given genetic material with scAAV vectors containing a gene that creates proteins. Two types of vectors, the scAAV2 and scAAv6, were found to be the most effective way to deliver the genetic material into cells. Both vectors increase the production of gene proteins in patients with the damaged genes and in patients with healthy cells. Dichloroacetate, a drug used to treat genetic mitochondrial diseases (diseases where the miochondria cannot create enough energy for cells), is also used to activate pyruvate dehydrogenase, (an enzyme used in metabolism to create energy). The use of dichloroacetate did increase productivity of pyruvate dehydrogenase in cells with damaged genes involved in metabolism. Dichloroacetate did increase production of proteins from certain energy-related genes and activity in other parts of pyruvate dehydrogenase (a protein involved in the chemical process that creates energy for the body).

Challenges arise concerning how to optimally support the immune system in the general population, especially under self-confinement. An optimal immune response depends on an adequate diet and nutrition in order to keep infection at bay. For example, sufficient protein intake is crucial for optimal antibody production. Low micronutrient status, such as of vitamin A or zinc, has been associated with increased infection risk. Frequently, poor nutrient status is associated with inflammation and oxidative stress, which in turn can impact the immune system. Dietary constituents with especially high anti-inflammatory and antioxidant capacity include vitamin C, vitamin E, and phytochemicals such as carotenoids and polyphenols. Several of these can interact with transcription factors such as NF-kB and Nrf-2, related to anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, respectively. Vitamin D in particular may perturb viral cellular infection via interacting with cell entry receptors (angiotensin converting enzyme 2), ACE2. Dietary fiber, fermented by the gut microbiota into short-chain fatty acids, has also been shown to produce anti-inflammatory effects. In this review, we highlight the importance of an optimal status of relevant nutrients to effectively reduce inflammation and oxidative stress, thereby strengthening the immune system during the COVID-19 crisis.","The coronavirus-disease 2019 (COVID-19), a viral breathing-related disease, was announced as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization.

Due to its tolerability, this pleiotropic drug has been proposed not only as a mucolytic agent, but also as a preventive/therapeutic agent in a variety of disorders involving GSH depletion and oxidative stress. At very high doses, NAC is also used as an antidote against paracetamol intoxication. Thiols block the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 thereby hampering penetration of SARS-CoV-2 into cells. Based on a broad range of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory mechanisms, which are herein reviewed, the oral administration of NAC is likely to attenuate the risk of developing COVID-19, as it was previously demonstrated for influenza and influenza-like illnesses.

Pelargonium sidoides show immunomodulatory and antiviral properties in clinical and in vitro studies, and it inhibits replication of HCo-229E coronavirus. Glycyrrhiza glabra in combination with standard therapies significantly reduces the hospitalization rate and occurrence of COVID-19 symptoms. As complementary therapies lianhuaqingwen capsules and jinhua qinggan granules reduces hospitalization rates, time to symptoms recovery and improve patient psychological comfort. In view of SARS-CoV-2 other herbs are not effective, e.g. maxingshigan-yinqiaosan, or therapeutic concentration would be impossible to achieve, e.g. ephedra herb, or there is simply no proper data.

We discovered that the human kidney expresses class I HDACs. Kidney medulla-specific inhibition of class I HDACs in the rat during high-salt feeding results in hypertension, polyuria, hypokalemia, and nitric oxide deficiency. Three new inducible murine models were used to determine that HDAC1 and HDAC2 in the kidney epithelium are necessary for maintaining epithelial integrity and maintaining fluid-electrolyte balance during increased dietary sodium intake. Moreover, single-nucleus RNA-sequencing determined that epithelial HDAC1 and HDAC2 are necessary for expression of many sodium or water transporters and channels. In performing a systematic review and meta-analysis of serious adverse events associated with clinical HDAC inhibitor use, we found that HDAC inhibitors increased the odds ratio of experiencing fluid-electrolyte disorders, such as hypokalemia. This study provides insight on the mechanisms of potential serious adverse events with HDAC inhibitors, which may be fatal to critically ill patients.

The role of Kir5.1 (encoded by Kcnj16) in mediating effects of dietary potassium intake on the NCC and renal potassium excretion is unknown. Methods: We used electrophysiology, renal clearance, and immunoblotting to study Kir4.1 in the DCT and NCC in Kir5.1 knockout (Kcnj16-/- ) and wild-type (Kcnj16+/+ ) mice fed with normal, high, or low potassium diets. Results: We detected a 40-pS and 20-pS potassium channel in the basolateral membrane of the DCT in wild-type and knockout mice, respectively. Compared with wild-type, Kcnj16-/- mice fed a normal potassium diet had higher basolateral potassium conductance, a more negative DCT membrane potential, higher expression of phosphorylated NCC (pNCC) and total NCC (tNCC), and augmented thiazide-induced natriuresis. Neither high- nor low-potassium diets affected the basolateral DCT's potassium conductance and membrane potential in Kcnj16-/- mice. Although high potassium reduced and low potassium increased the expression of pNCC and tNCC in wild-type mice, these effects were absent in Kcnj16-/- mice. High potassium intake inhibited and low intake augmented thiazide-induced natriuresis in wild-type but not in Kcnj16-/- mice. Compared with wild-type, Kcnj16-/- mice with normal potassium intake had slightly lower plasma potassium but were more hyperkalemic with prolonged high potassium intake and more hypokalemic during potassium restriction. Conclusions: Kir5.1 is essential for dietary potassium's effect on NCC and for maintaining potassium homeostasis.","Potassium channels are proteins that allow rapid and careful flow of potassium ions (an atom that carries an electrical charge) across the cell boundary and generates electrical signals in cells. Two potassium channels located in cells of the kidneys called potassium channels Kir4.1 and Kir5.1 play a key role on controlling how potassium from foods affect how salt is reabsorbed. The role of Kir5.1 in how it passes on potassium from foods in the kidneys and how it releases potassium is unknown. Researchers studied Kir4.1 and Kir5.1 in different parts of the kidneys by using two different types of mice (called wild-type mice - or normal mice - and knockout mice - mice without a specific gene like the one encoding Kir5.1) fed with normal, high, or low potassium diets. When compared with the wild-type mice, the knockout mice that were fed a normal potassium diet had higher transmission of potassium, had more negative charges in some cell boundaries or membranes, had higher activation of major salt reabsorption pathways, and had an increase in the release of sodium in the urine. Neither a diet high nor low in potassium affected the potassium channel that is located at the base or sides of the cell or the negative charges in the cell membranes in the knockout mice. Although high potassium reduced activation of major salt reabsorption pathways and low potassium increased activation of major salt reabsorption pathways in wild-type mice, these effects were not found in the knockout mice. High potassium diets slowed or stopped release of sodium in the urine while low potassium diets increased the release of sodium in the urine in wild-type mice but not in knock-out mice. When compared with wild-type mice, knockout mice who had normal potassium level diets had slightly lower plasma potassium (potassium in the blood). However, knockout mice were more hyperkalemic (having a higher than normal level of potassium in the bloodstream) with a long, high potassium diet and hypokalemic (having a lower than normal level of potassium in the blood) with a restricted potassium diet. Kir5.1 is key for the effect of potassium from foods on how salt is reabsorbed and for maintaining a stable balance of potassium.",1,B

15,27536695,"Background: Potassium (K(+)) is the major intracellular cation, with 98% of the total pool being located in the cells at a concentration of 140-150 mmol/l, and only 2% in the extracellular fluid, where it ranges between 3.5 and 5 mmol/l. A fine regulation of the intracellular-extracellular gradient is crucial for life, as it is the main determinant of membrane voltage; in fact, acute changes of K(+) plasma levels may have fatal consequences. Summary: An integrated system including an 'internal' and 'external' control prevents significant fluctuations of plasma levels in conditions of K(+) loading and depletion. The internal control regulates the intra-extracellular shift, a temporary mechanism able to maintain a constant K(+) plasma concentration without changing the total amount of body K(+). The external control is responsible for the excretion of the ingested K(+), and it has the kidney as the major player. The kidney excretes nearly 90% of the daily intake. Along the proximal tubule and the thick ascending limb on Henle's loop, the amount of K(+) reabsorption is quite fixed (about 80-90%); conversely, the distal nephron has the ability to adjust K(+) excretion in accordance with homeostatic needs. The present review analyzes: (1) the main molecular mechanisms mediating K(+) reabsorption and secretion along the nephron; (2) the pathophysiology of the principal K(+) derangements due to renal dysfunction, and (3) the effect of ingested K(+) on blood pressure and renal electrolyte handling. Key messages: Maintaining plasma K(+) levels in a tight range is crucial for life; thus, multiple factors are implicated in K(+) homeostasis, including kidney function. Recent studies have suggested that K(+) plasma levels, in turn, affect renal salt absorption in animal models; this effect may underlie the reduction of blood pressure observed in hypertensive subjects under K(+) supplementation.","There is a large amount of potassium (a mineral the body needs to function properly) in the fluid within cells. Regulating or monitoring how potassium passes in and out of cells is very important, so sudden or major changes of potassium levels in the blood may be life-threatening. The body has a system with 'internal' and 'external' controls that prevents changes of blood levels when potassium is increasing or decreasing. The 'internal' control monitors the change in potassium as it moves in and out of cells to help maintain a stable level of potassium. The 'external' control is responsible for excreting (releasing) the potassium, and the kidney is the main part of this process. The kidney releases nearly 90% of the daily intake of potassium. In some parts within the kidney, potassium is reabsorbed at a fixed or constant amount, but other portions of the kidneys have the ability to adjust the release of potassium based on what is needed to maintain a potassium balance. This review analyzes the following: (1) the cell processes that reabsorb and release potassium along the nephron (a filter located in the kidneys); (2) the pathophysiology (functional changes in the body that come with a particular syndrome or disease) from renal (kidney-related) problems; and (3) the effect of ingested potassium from food on blood pressure and renal electrolytes. Key messages in this review are that maintaining potassium levels in the blood in a tight range is very important for life. Therefore, multiple factors are connected with potassium homeostasis (the correct amount of potassium for the body to function), including kidney function.

The classic mechanism of renal K secretion is focused on the connecting tubule and cortical collecting duct, in which K is uptaken by basolateral Na-K-ATPase and is secreted into the lumen by apical ROMK (Kir1.1) and Ca-activated big conductance K channel. Recently, genetic studies and animal models have indicated that inwardly rectifying K channel 4.1 (Kir4.1 or Kcnj10) in the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) may play a role in the regulation of K secretion in the aldosterone-sensitive distal nephron by targeting the NaCl cotransporter (NCC). This review summarizes recent progresses regarding the role of Kir4.1 in the regulation of NCC and K secretion. Recent findings: Kir4.1 is expressed in the basolateral membrane of the DCT, and plays a predominant role in contributing to the basolateral K conductance and in participating in the generation of negative membrane potential. Kir4.1 is also the substrate of src-family tyrosine kinase and the stimulation of src-family tyrosine kinase activates Kir4.1 activity in the DCT. The genetic deletion or functional inhibition of Kir4.1 depolarizes the membrane of the DCT, inhibits ste20-proline-alanine rich kinase, and suppresses NCC activity. Moreover, the downregulation of Kir4.1 increases epithelial Na channel expression in the collecting duct and urinary K excretion. Finally, mice with low Kir4.1 activity in the DCT are hypomagnesemia and hypokalemia. Summary: Recent progress in exploring the regulation and the function of Kir4.1 in the DCT strongly indicates that Kir4.1plays an important role in initiating the regulation of renal K secretion by targeting NCC and it may serves as a K sensor in the kidney.","Renal (kidney-related) secretion or release plays a key role in maintaining potassium homeostasis (processes used by the body to maintain a normal potassium concentration in the fluid outside the cells). Renal release of potassium mainly takes place within the kidneys through as series of tubes and ducts. Potassium is absorbed through the potassium channel that is located at the base or sides of the cell called the basolateral and is released into a tube called the lumen through potassium channels. Recent studies have suggested that potassium channels 4.1 (Kir4.1 or Kcnj10) located within the kidney at the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) (which connects to the duct system in the kidneys and helps with salt and water reabsorption) may play a role in regulating the release of potassium by targeting the NaCl cotransporter (NCC) (the carrier protein that helps reabsorb sodium and chloride ions from tube fluid into the cells). This review summarizes recent progress on the role of the potassium channel Kir4.1 in the control of NCC and potassium secretion (release). Recent findings show that Kir4.1 is activated in the basolateral membrane (the thin layer surrounding a cell located at the base or sides of the cell) of the distal convoluted tubule (DCT). Kir4.1 plays a major role in helping the basolateral pass potassium through the cell and in helping cell membranes have a negative charge. Kir4.1 also activates proteins that send signals to other cells which in turn activate Kir4.1 activity in the DCT. Kir4.1 depolarizes (changes the internal charge to make the cell less negative) the membrane of the distal convoluted tubule (DCT), slows down other proteins that regulate cell activity, and suppresses NaCl cotransporter activity. Additionally, the decrease in function of Kir4.1 increases activity of the epithelial Na channel (the lining of the outer part of the kidney tubule) in the ducts and potassium release through urine. Finally, mice with low Kir4.1 activity in the DCT are hypomagnesemia (have a low level of the magnesium mineral in the blood) and hypokalemia (have low levels of potassium). In summary, recent progress in exploring the control and function of Kir4.1 in the distal convoluted tubule suggests that Kir4.1 has an important role in starting the regulation of releasing potassium in the kidneys by targeting NaCl cotransporter and may be a potassium sensor in the kidney.",1,B

Summary: Recent progress in exploring the regulation and the function of Kir4.1 in the DCT strongly indicates that Kir4.1plays an important role in initiating the regulation of renal K secretion by targeting NCC and it may serves as a K sensor in the kidney.","Kidney-related potassium (K) secretion helps maintain K balance. Kidney-related K removal commonly focuses on specific parts of sub-kidney units. In these units, K is pulled in by outer-facing protein, which transports K and sodium across a boundary, and is secreted into the inner tube by ROMK (Kir1.1), a K-specific transport protein, and calcium-activated K-specific transport channel. Recently, gene-related studies and animal models have shown that inwardly correcting potassium channel 4.1 (Kir4.1 or Kcnj10) in a specific region of sub-kidney units may monitor potassium secretion in the hormone-sensitive, outward sub-kidney unit by targeting the sodium-chloride cotransporter. This review summarizes recent improvements regarding the role of Kir4.1 channel in regulating the sodium-chloride cotransporter and potassium secretion. Kir4.1 is active in the outer-facing boundary of a specific region of the sub-kidney units and helps transport potassium outward and create a negative boundary charge. Kir4.1 is also the target of a high-energy transporting protein. This transporting protein activates Kir4.1 activity in a specific region of sub-kidney units. The gene-related deletion or silencing of Kir4.1 changes the charge of the boundary of a specific region of sub-kidney units, blocks a high-energy transporting protein, and prevents sodium-chloride channel activity. Also, reducing Kir4.1 activity increases boundary-lining sodium channel activity in a specific region of sub-kidney units and K removal via urine. Finally, mice with low Kir4.1 activity in a specific region of sub-kidney units have low blood magnesium and low blood potassium. Recent progress in exploring the monitoring and use of Kir4.1 in a specific region of sub-kidney units shows that Kir4.1 helps begin the monitoring of kidney-related K removal by targeting sodium-chloride channels. Kir4.1 may also be a K sensor in the kidney.",2,B
15,27151921,"We recently described a novel thiazide-sensitive electroneutral NaCl transport mechanism resulting from the parallel operation of the Cl-/HCO3- exchanger pendrin and the Na+-driven Cl-/2HCO3- exchanger (NDCBE) in β-intercalated cells of the collecting duct. Although a role for pendrin in maintaining Na+ balance, intravascular volume, and BP is well supported, there is no in vivo evidence for the role of NDCBE in maintaining Na+ balance. Here, we show that deletion of NDCBE in mice caused only subtle perturbations of Na+ homeostasis and provide evidence that the Na+/Cl- cotransporter (NCC) compensated for the inactivation of NDCBE. To unmask the role of NDCBE, we generated Ndcbe/Ncc double-knockout (dKO) mice. On a normal salt diet, dKO and single-knockout mice exhibited similar activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, whereas only dKO mice displayed a lower blood K+ concentration. Furthermore, dKO mice displayed upregulation of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) and the Ca2+-activated K+ channel BKCa. During NaCl depletion, only dKO mice developed marked intravascular volume contraction, despite dramatically increased renin activity. Notably, the increase in aldosterone levels expected on NaCl depletion was attenuated in dKO mice, and single-knockout and dKO mice had similar blood K+ concentrations under this condition. In conclusion, NDCBE is necessary for maintaining sodium balance and intravascular volume during salt depletion or NCC inactivation in mice. Furthermore, NDCBE has an important role in the prevention of hypokalemia. Because NCC and NDCBE are both thiazide targets, the combined inhibition of NCC and the NDCBE/pendrin system may explain thiazide-induced hypokalemia in some patients.","Past studies describe a new process to transport and reabsorb sodium and chloride ions (atoms or molecules that carry electrical charges) from one side of the cell to the other. One is called the Na+-driven Cl-/2HCO3- exchanger (NDCBE) that is a protein that exchanges Na+ (sodium) from outside the cell for Cl- (chloride) that is in the cell. There is no lab or test tube experiments that show evidence for the role of Na+-driven Cl-/2HCO3- exchanger (NDCBE) in maintaining a sodium balance. In this present study, researchers show that reducing Na+-driven Cl-/2HCO3- exchanger in mice causes only minor disruptions of sodium homeostasis (processes used by the body to maintain a normal sodium concentration in the fluid outside the cells). Researchers provide evidence that the Na+/Cl- cotransporter (NCC) (the carrier protein that helps reabsorb sodium and chloride ions from tube fluid into the cells) compensated for the lack of action of the Na+-driven Cl-/2HCO3- exchanger. To understand the role of Na+-driven Cl-/2HCO3- exchanger, researchers generated an experiment with Ndcbe/Ncc double-knockout mice, mice without NCC or NDCBE. On a normal diet, Ndcbe/Ncc double-knockout and single-knockout mice showed similar activation of the hormone system that helps regulate blood pressure, electrolytes, and some heart-related function; however, only Ndcbe/Ncc double-knockout mice showed lower potassium in the blood. Also, Ndcbe/Ncc double-knockout mice showed an increase in the surface sodium channels (ENaC) and the potassium channel Ca2+-activated K+ channels BKCa. When sodium-chloride is depleted, only Ndcbe/Ncc double-knockout mice developed altered blood volume contraction, despite increased kidney activity. Notably, the increase in aldosterone (a hormone that regulates sodium and potassium levels) expected from the sodium-chloride loss was weakened in Ndcbe/Ncc double-knockout mice. Single knock-out and Ndcbe/Ncc double-knockout mice had similar blood potassium concentrations when this occurred. In conclusion, the Na+-driven Cl-/2HCO3- exchanger is necessary for maintaining sodium balance and volume of blood when salt is reduced or when Na+/Cl- cotransporter Is turned off in mice. Furthermore, Na+-driven Cl-/2HCO3- exchanger has an important role in preventing hypokalemia (low levels of potassium). Because Na+/Cl- cotransporter and Na+-driven Cl-/2HCO3- exchanger are both targets of thiazide targets (which reduces sodium reabsorption), the combined slowing of Na+/Cl- cotransporter and the Na+-driven Cl-/2HCO3- exchanger/pendrin system (a multifaceted transporter that plays important roles in various functions of the kidney) may explain thiazide generated hypokalemia in some patients.",1,B
15,27068441,"STE20 (Sterile 20)/SPS-1 related proline/alanine-rich kinase (SPAK) and oxidative stress-response kinase-1 (OSR1) activate the renal cation cotransporters Na(+) -K(+) -2Cl(-) cotransporter (NKCC2) and Na(+) -Cl(-) cotransporter (NCC) via phosphorylation. Knockout mouse models suggest that OSR1 mainly activates NKCC2, while SPAK mainly activates NCC, with possible cross-compensation. We tested the hypothesis that disrupting both kinases causes severe polyuria and salt-wasting by generating SPAK/OSR1 double knockout (DKO) mice. DKO mice displayed lower systolic blood pressure compared with SPAK knockout (SPAK-KO) mice, but displayed no severe phenotype even after dietary salt restriction. Phosphorylation of NKCC2 at SPAK/OSR1-dependent sites was lower than in SPAK-KO mice, but still significantly greater than in wild type mice. In the renal medulla, there was significant phosphorylation of NKCC2 at SPAK/OSR1-dependent sites despite a complete absence of SPAK and OSR1, suggesting the existence of an alternative activating kinase. The distal convoluted tubule has been proposed to sense plasma [K(+) ], with NCC activation serving as the primary effector pathway that modulates K(+) secretion, by metering sodium delivery to the collecting duct. Abundance of phosphorylated NCC (pNCC) is dramatically lower in SPAK-KO mice than in wild type mice, and the additional disruption of OSR1 further reduced pNCC. SPAK-KO and kidney-specific OSR1 single knockout mice maintained plasma [K(+) ] following dietary potassium restriction, but DKO mice developed severe hypokalaemia. Unlike mice lacking SPAK or OSR1 alone, DKO mice displayed an inability to phosphorylate NCC under these conditions. These data suggest that SPAK and OSR1 are essential components of the effector pathway that maintains plasma [K(+) ].","Two protein enzymes called STE20 (Sterile 20)/SPS-1 related proline/alanine-rich kinase (SPAK) and oxidative stress-response kinase-1 (OSR1) activate the kidney-related cotransporters (carrier proteins that carry two different ions or other species from one side of the cell to the other) Na(+) -K(+) -2Cl(-) cotransporter (NKCC2) and Na(+) -Cl(-) cotransporter (NCC). Knockout mouse models (experiments with mice that lack a specific gene) suggest that OSR1 mainly activates NKCC2, while SPAK mainly activates NCC, and sometimes compensate for one another. Researchers tested the idea that disrupting both enzymes causes severe polyuria (passing unusually large amounts of urine) and salt-wasting by producing SPAK/OSR1 double knockout (DKO) mice - mice without SPAK or OSR1. DKO mice showed lower systolic blood pressure (the top number of blood pressure that indicates how much pressure the blood is exerting against artery walls when the heart beats) compared to SPAK knockout (SPAK-KO) mice, but showed no severe phenotype (observable traits or characteristics) even after salt restriction in food. Phosphorylation (a process of adding a phosphate group, a group of atoms that have different roles and make up DNA and RNA, to a molecule to prepare it to change or do work) of NKCC2 at SPAK/OSR1-dependent sites was lower than in SPAK-KO mice (mice without SPAK), but still much greater than in wild-type or normal mice. In the innermost part of the kidney called the medulla, there was significant phosphorylation of NKCC2 at SPAK/OSR1-dependent sites despite a complete absence of SPAK and OSR1, which suggests the existence of another activating kinase enzyme. The distal convoluted tubule (a part within the kidney that connects to the collecting duct system that refines salt and water reabsorption) has been suggested to sense blood potassium by monitoring sodium delivery to the collecting duct. A lot of phosphorylated Na(+) -Cl(-) cotransporter (pNCC) is dramatically lowered in SPAK-KO mice than in wild type mice, and the additional disruption of OSR1 further reduced pNCC. SPAK-KO and kidney-specific OSR1 single knockout mice (mice without OSR1 only in the kidney) maintained potassium in the blood following restrictions of potassium in food, but DKO mice developed severe hypokalemia (low levels of potassium in the blood). Unlike mice lacking SPAK or OSR1 alone, SPAK/OSR1 double knockout (DKO) mice showed an inability to phosphorylate NCC under these conditions.

Overall, the nutritional requirements of GDM are similar for all pregnancies, but special attention is paid to carbohydrates. Despite the classical intervention of restricting carbohydrates, the latest evidence, although limited, seems to favor a low-glycemic index diet.

18,23251152,"Group 1 (All Types of CHO) The intervention followed the American Dietetic Association nutrition practice guidelines for gestational diabetes. Women received an individual food plan based on CHO restriction (40–45% of TEI), using a CHO counting strategy (basic level). Moderate energy restriction was recommended only for overweight and obese women (24 kcal/kg). Breakfast CHO intake was limited to 15–30 g, and adequate fiber intake was promoted (20–35 g/day). Women in this group were advised to choose any type of CHO, except added refined sugars. Energy and CHO prescriptions were revised at every visit and changes were done according to weight gain and whether or not ketonuria was present. If ketones were present and weight gain was subnormal, energy prescription was increased (200 to 300 kcal/day). If weight gain was adequate, energy was not modified and carbohydrates were increased (no more than 45% of TEI). Fat intake recommendation was maintained (<40% of TEI), and protein recommendation adjustment was made accordingly (20–25% of TEI). Group 2 (Low GI CHO) Women in this group received the same intervention as women in Group 1, but were counseled to eliminate all moderate and high GI foods (GI > 55). Tropical fruits, refined breads, breakfast cereals, flour tortilla, white rice, refined cookies and pastries, potatoes, carrots, beets, and refined sugars were eliminated from their plan. Papaya was the only moderate GI fruit permitted because it is one of the most frequently consumed high-fiber foods in this population. Corn tortillas were included only when combined with beans, as well as corn flakes combined with milk, according to some evidence that the combination of these foods decreases their GI. Conclusions. Inclusion of low GI CHO as part of a comprehensive nutrition intervention is equally effective in improving glycemic control as compared to all types of CHO. This strategy had a positive effect in preventing excessive maternal weight gain but increased the risk of prematurity.","Group 1 of a study included all types of carbohydrates and followed the guidelines described by the American Dietetic Association, an organization of food and nutrition professionals, for gestational diabetes, a type of high blood sugar (diabetes) that develops during pregnancy in women who do not already have diabetes. Women each receive a food plan based on limiting carbohydrates, using a method that counts carbohydrates. Limiting the amount of calories and foods that generate energy consumed is recommend only for overweight or obese women. Breakfast carbohydrates eaten is limited, and adequate fiber consumed is increased. Women in this group are advised to choose any type of carbohydrate, except those with added refined sugars (processed sugars added to food). Energy and carbohydrate prescriptions are revised at every visit, and changes are done according to weight gain and whether or not ketonuria (high ketones, which is a chemical made in the liver that helps break down fat, in urine) is present. If ketones are present and weight gain is under the normal level, energy prescription is increased. If weight gain is enough, energy is not modified, and carbohydrates are increased. The recommendation for the amount of fat eaten stays the same, and the protein recommendation is adjusted accordingly. Group 2 focused on carbohydrates with a low glycemic index (a rating system used to measure how much specific foods increase blood sugar levels). Women in this group have the same program as women in Group 1, but are guided to remove all moderate and high glycemic index foods. Tropical fruits, refined (highly processed) breads, breakfast cereals, flour tortilla, white rice, refined cookies and pastries, potatoes, carrots, beets, and refined sugars are eliminated from their plan. Papaya was the only moderate glycemic index fruit permitted because it is one of the most frequently consumed high-fiber foods in this population. Corn tortillas are included only when combined with beans, as well as corn flakes combined with milk, based on some evidence that the combination of these foods decreases their glycemic index. In conclusion, including low glycemic index carbohydrates as part of a well-rounded nutrition program is just as effective in improving glycemic control as compared to all types of carbohydrates. This strategy has a positive effect in preventing too much maternal weight gain but increases the risk of prematurity (a baby born before 37 weeks).",1,C

We hypothesized that modestly lower carbohydrate intake would not increase ketonemia. Objective: To compare blood ketone concentration, risk of ketonemia, and pregnancy outcomes in women with GDM randomly assigned to a lower carbohydrate diet or routine care. Methods: Forty-six women aged (mean ± SEM) 33.3 ± 0.6 y and prepregnancy BMI 26.8 ± 0.9 kg/m2 were randomly assigned at 28.5 ± 0.4 wk to a modestly lower carbohydrate diet (MLC, ∼135 g/d carbohydrate) or routine care (RC, ∼200 g/d) for 6 wk.

18,17596470,"Nutrient intake plays a significant role in the health outcomes of all pregnant women. In a pregnancy complicated by gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), excellent glucose control is as foundational as appropriate weight gain and adequate nutrient intake.

Signs that food restrictions have gone too far include weight loss or lack of weight gain, undereating to avoid insulin therapy, positive urinary ketones, and intentional restriction of healthy foods. If a balance between nutrient needs and glucose control cannot be achieved, then concurrent medication therapy is needed to assist in reducing insulin resistance and supplementing insulin production to provide normoglycemia and improved pregnancy outcomes. Medical nutrition therapy is a self-management therapy. Education, support, and follow-up are required to assist the woman to make lifestyle changes essential to successful nutrition therapy.

Signs that limiting food have gone too far include weight loss or lack of weight gain, undereating to avoid insulin (a hormone in the body that allows cells in the muscles, fat, and liver to absorb sugar that is in the blood) therapy to keep blood sugar normal, positive ketones in urine that indicate the body is using fat for fuel instead of sugar, and planned limits of healthy foods.

18,1770194,"The extent to which given levels of caloric restriction will improve glycemic status but increase plasma ketone bodies in gestational diabetic women has received little attention. After reviewing the underlying physiology, we present data on two feeding studies investigating the question. In the first, a weight-maintaining approximately 2400-kcal/day diet was fed on a metabolic ward to 12 gestational diabetic women for 1 week. In the second week, subjects were randomized to a continuation of the 2400-kcal/day diet or to a 1200-kcal/day diet. Twenty-four-hour mean glucose levels remained unchanged in the control group but declined in the calorie-restricted group (6.7 mM or 121 mg/dl in week 1 vs 5.4 mM or 97.3 mg/dl in week 2) (p less than 0.01). Nine-hour overnight fasting plasma insulin also declined but oral glucose tolerance did not improve with caloric restriction. Fasting plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate rose in the calorie-restricted group, along with an increase in ketonuria, but not in the control group. A second study compared the impact of a 33% calorie-restricted diet or insulin to a full-calorie diet in a similar 2-week experimental design and measured hepatic glucose output and insulin sensitivity with dideuterated glucose before and during an insulin clamp. Diet in three subjects improved fasting and 24-hr mean glucose by 22 and 10%, respectively, whereas prophylactic insulin in three subjects produced 0 and 4% reductions, respectively. On average, ketonuria after a 9-hr fast declined to an equivalent degree with both treatments. Hepatic glucose output and insulin sensitivity were not statistically significantly altered by gestational diabetes or the therapeutic interventions compared to nondiabetic normal weight or obese pregnant controls. In conclusion, 50% caloric restriction improves glycemic status in obese women with gestational diabetes but is associated with an increase in ketonuria, which is of uncertain significance. An intermediate 33% level of caloric restriction (to 1600-1800 kcal daily) may be more appropriate in dietary management of obese woman with gestational diabetes mellitus and more effective than prophylactic insulin. Further studies are required to confirm these findings.","How much caloric restriction (reducing the amount of calories consumed) will improve glycemic status (blood sugar levels) but increase ketone bodies (substances that the body makes if the cells don't get enough blood sugar) in gestational diabetic women (women diagnosed with diabetes for the first time during pregnancy) has received little attention. Data are presented on two studies that monitor and control diets to investigate these questions. In the first study, a diet of 2,400 calories per day is provided to 12 gestational diabetic women for 1 week. In the second week, patients were randomly assigned to either continue the 2,400 calories per day diet or to a 1,200 calories per day diet. The average glucose (blood sugar) levels remained unchanged in the 2,400 calorie diet group but declined in the lower calorie group that had a 1,200 calories per day diet. After fasting (no food) for 9 hours overnight, insulin (a hormone in the body that allows cells in the muscles, fat, and liver to absorb sugar that is in the blood) also declined, but oral glucose tolerance (a test that measures how the body moves sugar from blood to the tissues) did not improve with the reduced calories diet. Beta-hydroxybutyrate (a chemical in the body that provides energy when not enough carbohydrates or sugars have been eaten) increased in the reduced calorie group, along with an increase in ketonuria, high amounts of ketones (substances that your body makes if your cells don't get enough blood sugar) in the urine, but not in the comparison group that had the 2,400 calorie diet. A second study compared the impact of a calorie-restricted diet reduced by 33% or insulin to a full-calorie diet in a similar 2 week experiment. The study measured liver production of sugar and insulin sensitivity with labeled glucose before and during an insulin clamp (used to maintain glucose levels). Diet in 3 patients improved fasting and average glucose levels. Prophylactic insulin (insulin administered to the patient) in 3 people also produced smaller reductions. On average, ketonuria after a 9 hour fast declined in the same amount with both treatments. Liver glucose production and insulin sensitivity were not significantly changed by gestational diabetes or the treatments compared to normal weight or obese pregnant women who did not have diabetes. In conclusion, reducing calories by half improves blood sugar levels in obese women with gestational diabetes but is connected with an increase in high amounts of ketones in the urine, which is of uncertain significance. Reducing calories by 33% (to 1,600 - 1,800 calories daily) may be better in diet management of obese women with gestational diabetes mellitus and more effective than prophylactic insulin.

To define a normal ketonemia threshold for the controls and to determine whether or not this value could play a role in the clinical management of women with GDM. Method: Fifty-six women with a normal OGTT and 49 women with GDM were included and monitored from the 25th to the 37th week of pregnancy. Control subjects agreed to perform glycaemia and ketonemia self-monitoring 3 times a day. In addition, women with GDM were asked to measure their postprandial glycaemia. Glycaemia and ketonemia measurements were performed using Optium meters. Subjects kept a 24-hour food record twice a week. Results: The mean ketonemia was lower in the control group than in the GDM group (0.01+/-0.10 vs. 0.04+/-0.009 mmol/l; P<0.001). Ketonemia values measured before the midday meal and prior to the evening meal were lower for control subjects than for GDM patients (P=0.002 and P=0.005). Fasting ketonemia was unrelated to ketonuria in the GDM group, whereas there was a correlation in the control group (P=0.006). At least one chronic increase in ketonemia levels was observed in 47% of the women with GDM, compared with only 12% of controls. The lowest levels of evening glycaemia correlated with the highest levels of ketonemia; women with GDM reported lower food and carbohydrate intakes than controls (P<0.001).

In addition, women with gestational diabetes were asked to measure their blood glucose after a meal. Glycaemia and ketonemia measurements are performed using a small finger stick device. Study participants keep a 24-hour food diary twice a week. The average ketonemia is lower in the comparison group than in the gestational diabetes group. Ketonemia values measured before the midday meal and before the evening meal are lower for the comparison group than for patients with gestational diabetes. Fasting (no food) ketonemia is unrelated to ketonuria (high amounts of ketones in the urine) in the gestational diabetes group, whereas there is a connection in the comparison group. At least one chronic (recurring) increase in ketonemia levels is observed in 47% of the women with gestational diabetes, compared with only 12% in the comparison group. The lowest levels of evening glycaemia correlated with the highest levels of ketonemia; women with gestational diabetes reported lower food and carbohydrate intakes than the comparison group. In conclusion, this work has established ketonemia standards in pregnant women who do not have diabetes. If ketonemia does indicate overly restrictive dietary behavior, this measure could be used for monitoring how well people stick to the nutritional recommendations for gestational diabetes.",1,C
18,17296512,"Aim: To measure ketonemia in a control population of pregnant women and in a population of women with gestational diabetes (GDM). To define a normal ketonemia threshold for the controls and to determine whether or not this value could play a role in the clinical management of women with GDM. Method: Fifty-six women with a normal OGTT and 49 women with GDM were included and monitored from the 25th to the 37th week of pregnancy. Control subjects agreed to perform glycaemia and ketonemia self-monitoring 3 times a day. In addition, women with GDM were asked to measure their postprandial glycaemia. Glycaemia and ketonemia measurements were performed using Optium meters. Subjects kept a 24-hour food record twice a week. Results: The mean ketonemia was lower in the control group than in the GDM group (0.01+/-0.10 vs. 0.04+/-0.009 mmol/l; P<0.001). Ketonemia values measured before the midday meal and prior to the evening meal were lower for control subjects than for GDM patients (P=0.002 and P=0.005). Fasting ketonemia was unrelated to ketonuria in the GDM group, whereas there was a correlation in the control group (P=0.006). At least one chronic increase in ketonemia levels was observed in 47% of the women with GDM, compared with only 12% of controls. The lowest levels of evening glycaemia correlated with the highest levels of ketonemia; women with GDM reported lower food and carbohydrate intakes than controls (P<0.001). Conclusion: This work has enabled the establishment of ketonemia reference standards in non-diabetic pregnant women. If ketonemia does indeed indicate overly restrictive dietary behavior, this parameter could be employed for monitoring adherence to the nutritional recommendations for GDM.","The aim is to measure blood ketone bodies (particles made from fat breakdown) in a baseline group of pregnant women and group with gestational diabetes (high blood sugar affecting pregnant women). To define a normal baseline level of blood ketone bodies, made from fat breakdown, and determine if this value could aid management of pregnant women with gestational diabetes or high blood sugar. Fifty-six standard women and 49 with gestational diabetes were measured from the 25th to 37th week of pregnancy. Standard women performed measurements of blood sugar and blood ketone bodies 3 times a day. Also, pregnant gestational diabetics with high blood sugar were asked to measure after-meal blood sugar. Blood and ketone measurements were recorded. Patients kept a 24-hour food record twice a week. Average blood ketone bodies were lower in the standard group than the group with gestational diabetes. Blood ketone bodies measured before the midday and evening meals were lower for standard patients than gestational diabetics. Fasting blood ketone bodies were unrelated to urinary ketone bodies in the pregnant gestational diabetics, unlike the standard group. At least one long-lasting increase in blood ketone bodies occured in 47% of pregnant women with gestational diabetes compared to only 12% of standard patients. The lowest levels of evening blood sugar paralleled the highest levels of blood ketone bodies. Pregnant gestational diabetics with high blood sugar reported lower food and carb intakes than standard women. This work created baselines of blood ketone bodies in non-diabetic pregnant women. If blood ketone bodies do indicate restricting diets, this value may monitor faithfulness to diet recommendations for pregnant gestational diabetics with high blood sugar.",2,C
18,18058723,"Introduction: Nutrition therapy is an integral part of the management of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Most women with GDM are treated by nutritional management alone. The goal of our study was to compare low and high carbohydrate diets in their effectiveness, safety and tolerability in women with GDM. Material and methods: The study group consisted of 30 Caucasian women newly diagnosed with GDM, with a mean age of 28.7 +/- 3.7 years and pregnancy duration of 29.2 +/- 5.4 weeks. The patients were randomised into two groups: those on a low and those on a high carbohydrate diet (45% vs. 65% respectively of energy supply coming from carbohydrates). The presence of urine ketones was controlled every day. After two weeks daily glucose profiles and compliance with the recommended diets were analysed. Results: Glucose concentration before implementation of the diet regimen did not differ between groups. No changes in fasting blood glucose were noticed in the group that had followed a low carbohydrate diet, although a significant decrease in glucose concentration was observed after breakfast (102 +/- 16 vs. 94 +/- 11 mg/dl), lunch (105 +/- 12 vs. 99 +/- 9 mg/dl) and dinner (112 +/- 16 vs. 103 +/- 13 mg/dl) (p < 0.05). In the high carbohydrate diet group fasting and after-breakfast glucose concentration did not change. A significant decrease in glycaemia was noticed after lunch (106 +/- 15 vs. 96 +/- 7 mg/dl) and dinner (107 +/- 12 vs. 97 +/- 7 mg/dl) (p < 0.05). Ketonuria was not observed in either group. Obstetrical outcomes did not differ between groups. Conclusions: Both high and low carbohydrate diets are effective and safe. A diet with carbohydrate limitation should be recommended to women who experience the highest glycaemia levels after breakfast.","Nutrition therapy (treatment that uses food to prevent and reverse disease) is a key part of the care of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) (women diagnosed with diabetes for the first time during pregnancy). Most women with GDM are treated only by managing their nutrition. The goal of this study is to compare low and high carbohydrate (carbohydrates that provide fuel for the body often found in sugary foods, pasta, and bread) diets. The study group has 30 white women newly diagnosed with gestational diabetes mellitus. The patients are randomly put into two groups: those on a low carbohydrate (carb) diet and those on a high carb diet. The presence of urine ketones (substances that the body makes if cells don't get enough blood sugar) is controlled every day. After two weeks, how well women stayed on the recommend diets and daily blood sugar measures were analyzed. Blood sugar levels before starting the new diets did not differ between the two groups. No changes in fasting blood sugar (blood sugar levels after not eating for set amount of time) are noticed in the group that has a low carb diet, although a significant decrease in blood sugar is seen after breakfast, lunch, and dinner. In the high carb diet group, fasting and after breakfast blood sugar levels did not change. A significant decrease in glycaemia (concentration of blood sugar) is noticed after lunch. Ketonuria (high amounts of ketones in the urine) is not observed in either group. Pregnancy outcomes did not differ between the two groups. In conclusion, both high and low carb diets are effective and safe. A diet that limits carbs should be recommended to women who experience the highest concentration of blood sugar levels after breakfast.",1,C
18,10521751,"Objective: The object of the study was to determine whether time of day, interval after a standard meal, and maternal body mass influence plasma glucose concentrations in women with gestational diabetes mellitus. Study design: Identical mixed meals were administered on 2 separate occasions 1 week apart to 30 women with dietarily treated gestational diabetes and pregnancies between 28 and 38 weeks' gestation. One meal was administered at 7 AM (morning meal) and the other was administered at 9 PM (evening meal), each after a fast of >/=5 hours. The order of the meals (morning first versus evening first) was assigned randomly. Sixteen of the women had a body mass index >/=27 kg/m(2) (overweight) and 14 women had a body mass index <27 kg/m(2) (lean). Venous plasma concentrations of glucose, insulin, free fatty acids, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and bound and free cortisol were measured hourly for 9 hours after each of the test meals. Results: When all women were considered together glucose concentrations after the morning meal were significantly greater at 1 hour, were not different at 2 hours, and were significantly lower from 3 through 9 hours postprandially than those at corresponding times after the evening meal. Plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate and free fatty acid concentrations were higher between 5 and 9 hours after the morning meal than at the same times after the evening meal. Total and free cortisol levels were higher for the first 7 hours after the morning feeding, reflecting known diurnal variation in cortisol concentrations. Overweight patients' glucose values were significantly greater than those of lean subjects during the last 4 hours of the overnight fast. Conclusions: Among women with dietarily treated gestational diabetes the glucose concentrations were significantly higher from 3 to 9 hours after an evening meal, whereas suppression of free fatty acids and beta-hydroxybutyrate was less sustained after a morning feeding. The mechanisms underlying these differences remain to be determined but may involve diurnal influences of counterregulatory hormones. The relationships between measurements of maternal glycemia and maternal and perinatal outcomes in pregnancies complicated by gestational diabetes may be clarified by establishing a uniform duration of a fast and by developing meal-specific preprandial and postprandial maternal glucose targets for these patients.","The objective of this study is to determine whether time of day, the interval after a standard meal, and maternal body mass (body fat based on height and weight) influence the amount of blood sugar in women with gestational diabetes mellitus (a type of diabetes first seen during pregnancy in a woman who did not have diabetes before pregnancy). Identical mixed meals are given on 2 separate occasions 1 week apart to 30 women with gestational diabetes being treated by diet and who are pregnant. One meal is given at 7 am (morning meal) and the second meal is given at 9 pm (evening meal), each after a fast (no food) of 5 or more hours. The order of the meals (morning first versus evening first) is assigned randomly. Based on body mass index, 16 of the women are considered overweight, and 14 women are lean. Blood sugar from the vein, insulin (a hormone in the body that allows cells in the muscles, fat, and liver to absorb sugar that is in the blood), free fatty acids (lipids from fats and oils that are a source of energy for the body), beta-hydroxybutyrate (a chemical in the body that provides energy when not enough carbohydrates or sugars have been eaten), and bound and free cortisol (a stress hormone that is bound to proteins or free in the blood) are measured hourly for 9 hours after each of the test meals. When all women are measured together, blood sugar after the morning meal is much greater at 1 hour, are not different at 2 hours, and are much lower 3 through 9 hours after the meal than measurements taken at the same times after the evening meal. The chemical beta-hydroxybutyrate and free fatty acid levels are higher between 5 and 9 hours after the morning meal than at the same times after the evening meal. Levels of the stress hormone cortisol are higher for the first 7 hours after the morning meal, reflecting known daily variation in cortisol concentrations. Overweight patients' blood sugar levels are much greater than those of lean patients during the last 4 hours of the overnight fast. In conclusion, among women with gestational diabetes, the blood sugar levels are much higher from 3 to 9 hours after an evening meal, whereas slowing or stopping free fatty acid and beta-hydroxybutyrate use is less stable after a morning meal. The process causing these differences remain to be found but may involve daily influences of hormones that increase blood sugar. The relationships between measurements of blood sugar in pregnant women and maternal and perinatal (before and after birth) outcomes in pregnancies complicated by gestational diabetes may be cleared up by creating a standard time to fast and by developing meal-specific maternal blood sugar levels to aim to reach before and after meals for these patients.",1,C
18,9540949,"Objective: To determine the effect of carbohydrate restriction on perinatal outcome in patients with diet-controlled gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Methods: Women with diet-controlled GDM were divided non-randomly into two groups based on their dietary carbohydrate content: those with low dietary carbohydrate content (below 42%) and those with high dietary carbohydrate content (exceeding 45%). Subjects kept dietary accounts and were followed with daily fasting and postprandial glucose assessments. Subjects also were tested daily for urinary ketones. Glycosylated hemoglobin, mean fasting and postprandial glucose values, incidence of macrosomia and large for gestational age (LGA) infants, cesarean deliveries for cephalopelvic disproportion and macrosomia, and need for insulin therapy were compared between the groups. Results: The two groups were identical in terms of demographic characteristics. Significant reductions in the postprandial glucose values were seen among subjects in the low-carbohydrate group (P < .04). Fewer subjects in the low-carbohydrate group required the addition of insulin for glucose control (P < .047; relative risk [RR] 0.14; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.02, 1.00). The incidence of LGA infants was significantly lower in the low-carbohydrate group (P < .035; RR 0.22; 95% CI 0.05, 0.91). Subjects in the low carbohydrate group also had a lower rate of cesarean deliveries for cephalopelvic disproportion and macrosomia (P < .037; RR 0.15; 95% CI 0.04, 0.94).

Patients keep food diaries and are followed with assessments of daily fasting (no food) and blood sugar levels after meals. Patients also were tested daily for urinary ketones (chemicals in uring made from the liver that indicate the body is using fat for fuel instead of sugar). Glycosylated hemoglobin (a blood test that measures the percent of a protein found in blood red cells), average fasting and after meals blood sugar numbers, number of macrosomia (a newborn who is much larger than average) and large for gestational age infants (newborns who weighs more than 90% of other newborns of the same gestational age at birth), cesarean deliveries (C-section) for cephalopelvic disproportion (when a baby's head is too large to fit through the mother's pelvis) and macrosomia, and need for insulin therapy (a hormone in the body that allows cells in the muscles, fat, and liver to absorb sugar that is in the blood) are compared between the groups. The two groups are identical in terms of demographic characteristics such as age, race/ethnicity, geographic area, and income. Major decreases in the after meal blood sugar numbers are seen among patients in the low-carb group. Fewer patients in the low-carb group needed the additional insulin to control blood sugar. The number of large for gestational age infants was much lower in the low-carb group. Patients in the low-carb group also have lower rates of cesarean deliveries due to cephalopelvic disproportion (in which the baby's head is too large to fit through the mother's pelvis) and macrosomia (in which the newborn who is much larger than average). In conclusion, limiting carbohydrates in patients with diet-controlled gestational diabetes mellitus results in improved blood sugar control, less need for insulin therapy, a decrease in the number of large for gestational age infants, and a decrease in cesarean deliveries for cephalopelvic disproportion and macrosomia.",1,C

Subjects kept diet records and were followed with daily blood sugar measurements. Subjects also were tested daily for ketones in urine. Certain blood sugar and birth-related measurements were compared between groups. The two groups had identical socioeconomic traits. The low-carb group had reduced after-meal glucose levels. Less patients in the low-carb group needed insulin for glucose control. The frequency of large-for-prebirth-age infants was lower in the low-carb group. The low-carb group also had less cesarean deliveries for large-head babies and large-body babies.

18,19640342,"Current controversies for medical nutrition therapy in pregnancies complicated by diabetes include the composition and amount of carbohydrates and fats as well as optimal gestational weight gain and energy restriction. Although carbohydrate is the macronutrient with the greatest effect on glycemic control, there is little evidence for a recommended amount and type of carbohydrate or its distribution. This lack of evidence prompts an issue of debate among practitioners over the type of carbohydrate and its percent distribution throughout the day. The best indicators at this time are the results of self-monitoring of blood glucose, ketone testing, food records, and weight gain. A review of the literature provides the most current information available for medical nutrition therapy during a pregnancy complicated by diabetes and reinforces the need for further research in the form of randomized controlled trials to answer questions regarding carbohydrate modification and distribution, energy needs, and weight gain.","Current controversies and arguments for nutrition therapy (treatment based on food) in pregnancies that are complicated by diabetes (a chronic health condition that affects how the body turns food into energy) include the amount of carbohydrates (carbs) and fats, the best amount of weight to gain during pregnancy, and the best way to limit calories. There is little evidence for a recommended amount and type of carb or how it is distributed. This lack of evidence creates a disagreement among health care providers over the type of carb and amount that should be eaten throughout the day. The best measures at this time are the results of self-monitoring of blood sugar, testing for ketones (substances that the body makes if cells don't get enough blood sugar), food diaries, and weight gain.

19,33165964,"Background: No clinical trials have been specifically designed to compare medical treatments after surgery in Parkinson's disease (PD). Objective: Study's objective was to compare the efficacy and safety of levodopa versus dopamine agonist monotherapy after deep brain stimulation (DBS) in PD. Methods: Thirty-five surgical candidates were randomly assigned to receive postoperative monotherapy with either levodopa or dopamine agonist in a randomized, single-blind study. All patients were reevaluated in short- (3 months), mid- (6 months), and long-term (2.5 years) follow-up after surgery. The primary outcome measure was the change in the Non-Motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS) 3 months after surgery. Secondary outcome measures were the percentage of patients maintaining monotherapy, change in motor symptoms, and specific non-motor symptoms (NMS). Analysis was performed primarily in the intention-to-treat population. Results: Randomization did not significantly affect the primary outcome (difference in NMSS between treatment groups was 4.88 [95% confidence interval: -11.78-21.53, P = 0.566]). In short- and mid-term follow-up, monotherapy was safe and feasible in more than half of patients (60% in short- and 51.5% in mid-term follow-up), but it was more often possible for patients on levodopa. The ability to maintain dopamine agonist monotherapy was related to optimal contact location. In the long term, levodopa monotherapy was feasible only in a minority of patients (34.2%), whereas dopamine agonist monotherapy was not tolerated due to worsening of motor conditions or occurrence of impulse control disorders. Conclusions: This trial provides evidence for simplifying pharmacological treatment after functional neurosurgery for PD. The reduction in dopamine receptor agonists should be attempted while monitoring for occurrence of NMSs, such as apathy and sleep disturbances.","No clinical trials with patients have been developed to compare medical treatments after surgery in Parkinson's disease (a brain disorder that affects movement and coordination). The objective of this study is to compare the performance and safety of levodopa (a drug that enters the brain and helps replace missing dopamine, a chemical that carries signals between brain cells) versus dopamine agonist (a drug that imitates the actions of dopamine in the body) single therapy after deep brain stimulation (surgery that implants devices to stimulate certain areas of the brain) in patients with Parkinson's disease. In this study, 35 patients who are planning to undergo surgery are randomly assigned to receive either levodopa or dopamine agonist after surgery. All patients are evaluated in short (3 months), mid (6 months), and long-term (2.5 years) follow-up appointments after the surgery. The key outcome (result) researchers planned to evaluate is the change in the Non-Motor Symptoms Scale, a scale to count and measure severity of non-motor (unrelated to movement) symptoms such as pain and tiredness, 3 months after surgery. A second outcome is the percent of patients staying on only one drug, change in motor (movement) symptoms, and specific non-motor symptoms. The analysis mainly focuses on the patients who were enrolled and randomly assigned to treatment. Being randomly assigned into treatments did not significantly affect the key outcome from the Non-Motor Symptoms Scale between the two treatment groups. In the 3-month and 6-month follow-up appointments, single therapy (only one drug) is safe and practical in more than half of patients, but it was more often possible for patients on levodopa. The ability to maintain dopamine agonist as the only treatment drug is related to the best contact location. In the 2.5 year follow-up, levodopa single therapy is feasible only in a small number of patients, whereas dopamine agonist single therapy is not tolerated (unable to handle side effects) due to worsening of motor conditions or occurrence of impulse control disorders (disorders in which temptations or thoughts cannot be resisted). In conclusion, this study provides evidence for simplifying drug treatment after brain surgery for Parkinson's disease. The reduction in dopamine agonists should be attempted while monitoring for development of non-motor symptoms, such as lack of motivation and sleep disturbances.",1,C
19,32844196,"The natural pattern of progression of Parkinson's disease is largely unknown because patients are conventionally followed on treatment. As Parkinson's disease progresses, the true magnitude of the long-duration response to levodopa remains unknown, because it can only be estimated indirectly in treated patients. We aimed to describe the natural course of motor symptoms by assessing the natural OFF in consecutive Parkinson's disease patients never exposed to treatment (drug-naïve), and to investigate the effects of daily levodopa on the progression of motor disability in the OFF medication state over a 2-year period. In this prospective naturalistic study in sub-Saharan Africa, 30 Parkinson's disease patients (age at onset 58 ± 14 years, disease duration 7 ± 4 years) began levodopa monotherapy and were prospectively assessed using the Unified Parkinson's disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). Data were collected at baseline, at 1-year and 2-years follow-up. First-ever levodopa intake induced a significant improvement in motor symptoms (natural OFF versus ON state UPDRS-III 41.9 ± 15.9 versus 26.8 ± 15.1, respectively; P < 0.001). At 1-year follow-up, OFF state UPDRS-III score after overnight withdrawal of levodopa was considerably lower than natural OFF (26.5 ± 14.9; P < 0 .001). This effect was not modified by disease duration. At the 2-year follow-up, motor signs after overnight OFF (30.2 ± 14.2) were still 30% milder than natural OFF (P = 0.001). The ON state UPDRS-III at the first-ever levodopa challenge was similar to the overnight OFF score at 1-year follow-up and the two conditions were correlated (r = 0.72, P < 0.001). Compared to the natural progression of motor disability, levodopa treatment resulted in a 31% lower annual decline in UPDRS-III scores in the OFF state (3.33 versus 2.30 points/year) with a lower model's variance explained by disease duration (67% versus 36%). Using the equation regressed on pretreatment data, we predicted the natural OFF at 1-year and 2-year follow-up visits and estimated that the magnitude of the long-duration response to levodopa ranged between 60% and 65% of total motor benefit provided by levodopa, independently of disease duration (P = 0.13). Although levodopa therapy was associated with motor fluctuations, overnight OFF disability during levodopa was invariably less severe than the natural course of the disease, independently of disease duration. The same applies to the yearly decline in UPDRS-III scores in the OFF state. Further research is needed to clarify the mechanisms underlying the long-duration response to levodopa in Parkinson's disease. Understanding the natural course of Parkinson's disease and the long-duration response to levodopa may help to develop therapeutic strategies increasing its magnitude to improve patient quality of life and to better interpret the outcome of randomized clinical trials on disease-modifying therapies that still rely on the overnight OFF to define Parkinson's disease progression.","The natural development of Parkinson's disease (a brain disorder that affects movement and coordination) is largely unknown because patients are usually evaluated while on treatment. As Parkinson's disease progresses, the true impact of the long-term response to levodopa (a drug that enters the brain and helps replace missing dopamine, a chemical that carries signals between brain cells) remains unknown because it can only be estimated indirectly in treated patients. Researchers aimed to describe the natural progression of motor (movement) symptoms such as tremors, rigidity, and slowness of movement by evaluating the natural OFF state (when symptoms return) in patients with Parkinson's disease who have never taken drugs to treat the disease. Researchers also aimed to investigate the effects of daily levodopa on the progression of motor disability (partial or total loss of movement in part of the body) in the OFF medication state over a 2-year period. In this study in sub-Saharan Africa, 30 Parkinson's disease patients started levodopa and are assessed using the Unified Parkinson's disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), a rating tool used to measure the severity and progression of Parkinson's disease in patients. Data are collected at the start of the study and at 1-year and 2-year follow-up appointments. Taking levodopa for the first time has a significant improvement in motor symptoms. At 1-year follow-up, OFF state (when symptoms return) UPDRS-III score after overnight withdrawal of levodopa was considerably lower than natural OFF. This effect does not change based on how long the person has the disease. At the 2-year follow-up, motor signs after overnight OFF are still milder than natural OFF. The ON state (patient feels energetic and can move) UPDRS-III at the first-ever levodopa challenge is similar to the overnight OFF score at 1-year follow-up, and the two conditions are connected. Compared to the natural progression of motor disability, levodopa treatment resulted in a lower annual decline in UPDRS-III scores in the OFF state with a lower number than expected, which is explained by disease duration. Using data taken from before treatment started, researchers made predictions of the natural OFF at 1-year and 2-year follow-up visits and estimated that the magnitude of how long patients have a response to levodopa ranged between 60% and 65% of benefit on motor ability provided by levodopa, independently of how long patients had the disease. Although levodopa is linked to changes in motor ability, overnight OFF disability (when symptoms return) during levodopa is less severe than the natural course of the disease, independently of how long patients had the disease.

Understanding the natural course of Parkinson's disease and the long-duration response to levodopa may help to develop therapeutic strategies increasing its magnitude to improve patient quality of life and to better interpret the outcome of randomized clinical trials on disease-modifying therapies that still rely on the overnight OFF to define Parkinson's disease progression.","The natural progress of Parkinson's disease (a brain-related disorder affecting movement) is largely unknown because patients are usually examined during treatment. As Parkinson's disease progresses, the effect of the long-lasting response to levodopa (common Parkinsons's medication) remains unknown since it is measured indirectly in treated patients. We tried to describe the natural course of movement symptoms by measuring the OFF state when symptoms occur in patients never given treatment (drug-naïve) for Parkinson's disease. For 2 years, we also explored how daily levodopa affects the progression of movement symptoms in the OFF state after treatment wears off. In this lengthy, observational study in sub-Saharan Africa, 30 patients with Parkinson's disease (age at onset 58 ± 14 years, disease duration 7 ± 4 years) began levodopa therapy and were later measured with a specific disease scale for Parkinson's. Data were collected at start, 1-year, and 2-year follow-up. First-time levodopa intake improved movement symptoms. After 1 year, severity of symptoms of Parkinson's disease was lower after overnight withdrawal of levodopa than without it at all. The lowered severity by levodopa was not altered by disease length. After 2 years, movement signs after overnight withdrawal of medication was still 30% milder than movement signs with no treatment ever. The no-symptom state after first-time levodopa was similar and related to the overnight typical-symptom state after 1 year. Compared to the natural progression, levodopa reduces symptom severity via a 31% annual decline with some leeway due to disease duration. We calculated that the response to levodopa involved a possible 60-65% benefit of total motor activity, regardless of disease duration. While levodopa relates to movement fluctuations, the typical-symptom state after overnight levodopa withdrawal was less severe than without medication at all, regardless of disease duration. A yearly decline in symptom severity during the typical-symptom state also exists. We need more research to explain the mechanisms for the response to levodopa in Parkinson's disease. Understanding how Parkinson's disease progresses and the response to levodopa may help create better treatments and better assess clinical trials for Parkinson's disease.",2,C
19,32830901,"Degradation of striatal dopamine in Parkinson's disease (PD) may initially be supplemented by increased cognitive control mediated by cholinergic mechanisms. Shift to cognitive control of walking can be quantified by prefrontal cortex activation. Levodopa improves certain aspects of gait and worsens others, and cholinergic augmentation influence on gait and prefrontal cortex activity remains unclear. This study examined dopaminergic and cholinergic influence on gait and prefrontal cortex activity while walking in PD. A single-site, randomized, double-blind crossover trial examined effects of levodopa and donepezil in PD. Twenty PD participants were randomized, and 19 completed the trial. Participants were randomized to either levodopa + donepezil (5 mg) or levodopa + placebo treatments, with 2 weeks with treatment and a 2-week washout. The primary outcome was change in prefrontal cortex activity while walking, and secondary outcomes were change in gait and dual-task performance and attention. Levodopa decreased prefrontal cortex activity compared with off medication (effect size, -0.51), whereas the addition of donepezil reversed this decrease. Gait speed and stride length under single- and dual-task conditions improved with combined donepezil and levodopa compared with off medication (effect size, 1 for gait speed and 0.75 for stride length). Dual-task reaction time was quicker with levodopa compared with off medication (effect size, -0.87), and accuracy improved with combined donepezil and levodopa (effect size, 0.47). Cholinergic therapy, specifically donepezil 5 mg/day for 2 weeks, can alter prefrontal cortex activity when walking and improve secondary cognitive task accuracy and gait in PD. Further studies will investigate whether higher prefrontal cortex activity while walking is associated with gait changes.","Dopamine is a chemical messenger that carries signals between brain cells and affects mood, motivation, and movement. The breakdown and inactivation of dopamine in Parkinson's disease (PD) may initially be addressed by increased cognitive (thought-related) control brought about by cholinergic mechanisms (types of drugs that inhibit, enhance, or imitate the action of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, the primary signaling molecule of nerve cells). Shift to cognitive control of walking can be measured by prefrontal cortex activation (activating the part of the brain that controls behavior, such as decision-making). Levodopa (a drug that enters the brain and helps replace missing dopamine, a chemical that carries signals between brain cells) improves certain aspects of gait (how a person walks) and worsens others. Cholinergic influence on gait and prefrontal cortex activity remains unclear. This study examines dopaminergic (drugs that increase dopamine activity) and cholinergic influence on gait and prefrontal cortex activity while walking in PD. A clinical study examines the effects of levodopa and donepezil (a type of drug that helps mental function) in Parkinson's disease. In this study, 20 people with Parkinson's disease were randomly put in treatment groups, and 19 completed the study. Participants were randomly put in either the group that received both levodopa + donepezil or the group that received levodopa + placebo (sham) treatments, with 2 weeks spent on treatment and a 2-week washout (the study phase when the drug is stopped and no other drug is used). The main outcome (result) is change in prefrontal cortex activity while walking. Secondary outcomes are change in gait, dual-task performance (doing two tasks at the same time), and attention. Levodopa decreased prefrontal cortex activity (the part of the brain that controls behavior, such as decision-making) compared with off medication, whereas the addition of donepezil reversed this decrease. Gait speed and stride length while doing single- and dual-task conditions improved with combined donepezil and levodopa compared with off medication. Dual-task reaction time was quicker with levodopa compared with off medication, and accuracy improved with the combined donepezil and levodopa drugs.

19,32804544,"Introduction: Long-term treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) with levodopa is hampered by motor complications related to the inability of residual nigrostriatal neurons to convert levodopa to dopamine (DA) and use it appropriately. This generated a tendency to postpone levodopa, favoring the initial use of DA agonists, which directly stimulate striatal dopaminergic receptors. Use of DA agonists, however, is associated with multiple side effects and their efficacy is limited by suboptimal bioavailability. Areas covered: This paper reviewed the latest preclinical and clinical findings on the efficacy and adverse effects of non-ergot DA agonists, discussing the present and future of this class of compounds in PD therapy. Expert opinion: The latest findings confirm the effectiveness of DA agonists as initial treatment or adjunctive therapy to levodopa in advanced PD, but a more conservative approach to their use is emerging, due to the complexity and repercussions of their side effects. As various factors may increase the individual risk to side effects, assessing such risk and calibrating the use of DA agonists accordingly may become extremely important in the clinical management of PD, as well as the availability of new DA agonists with better profiles of safety and efficacy.","Long-term treatment of Parkinson's disease with levodopa (a drug that enters the brain and helps replace missing dopamine, a chemical that carries signals between brain cells) is slowed down by motor (movement) complications related to the inability of neurons to convert levodopa to dopamine (a chemical messenger that carries signals between brain cells and affects mood, motivation, and movement) and use it appropriately. This problem often leads to delaying the use of levodopa and using dopamine agonists (a medication that imitates the actions of dopamine in the body to relieve symptoms related to low levels of dopamine), which directly stimulates dopamine receptors or target sites in the brain. Using dopamine agonists, however, is connected with multiple side effects. Their performance is limited by the drug not being completely available to the intended part of the body. This paper reviews the latest findings from animal and human studies on the performance and negative effects of non-ergot dopamine agonists (newer types of drugs that imitate the effects of dopamine), discussing the present and future of this type of drug in Parkinson's disease. The latest findings confirm the effectiveness of dopamine agonists as the first treatment and as an additional drug to use with levodopa in advanced Parkinson's disease, but a more moderate approach to their use is emerging due to their side effects. As different factors may increase the risk to side effects, evaluating such risk and adjusting the use of dopamine agonists may become extremely important in the care of Parkinson's disease, as well as the availability of new dopamine agonists drugs with better safety and performance documented.",1,C
19,32721557,"Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most frequent neurodegenerative disease, has been linked to increased central and peripheral inflammation. Although the response of the immune system to dopaminergic treatment remains to be fully understood, dopaminergic agonists are known to exhibit immunoregulatory properties which may, at least in part, explain their therapeutic effect in PD. This highlights the need of analyzing immune parameters in longitudinal studies on PD patients receiving specific therapeutic regimes. In this work, PD patients were included in a two-year prospective study comparing the effect of levodopa alone and a levodopa/pramipexole combo therapy on several regulatory and pro-inflammatory immune cell populations. We demonstrated that PD patients show decreased circulating levels of several important regulatory subpopulations, as determined by flow cytometry. Notably, when administered alone, levodopa decreased the levels of functional Bregs and SLAMF1+ tolerogenic DCs and increased the levels of total and HLA-DR+ classical monocytes, while the pramipexole/levodopa combo may promote Treg- and tolerogenic DC-mediated regulatory responses.

This study compares the effect of levodopa (a drug that enters the brain and helps replace missing dopamine) alone and a combination of levodopa and pramipexole (dopamine-promoting) drugs on several regulating and pro-inflammatory (capable of causing inflammation) immune cells in the body. Researchers demonstrate that patients with Parkinson's disease show decreased levels of important cells that regulate the immune system. In particular, when given alone, levodopa decreases the levels of functional Bregs (a type of regulating immune cell) and SLAMF1+ tolerogenic DCs (immune receptors and cells that direct and regulate the immune response) and increases the levels of total and HLA DR+classical monocytes (molecules that produce antigens and fight inflammation). The combination of levodopa and pramipexole drugs may promote Treg- and tolerogenic DC responses (cells that regulate responses and may suppress immune response). These results suggest that treatment plans based on levodopa alone may promote a pro-inflammatory type of response in patients with Parkinson's disease, but when combined with pramipexole, it promotes a clinically helpful regulatory-type environment.",1,C

19,32710141,"Purpose: To investigate the comparative effectiveness of dopamine agonists and monoamine oxidase type-B (MAO-B) inhibitors available for treatment of Parkinson's disease. Methods: We performed a systematic literature search identifying randomized controlled trials investigating 4 dopamine agonists (cabergoline, pramipexole, ropinirole, rotigotine) and 3 MAO-B inhibitors (selegiline, rasagiline, safinamide) for Parkinson's disease. We extracted and pooled data from included clinical trials in a joint model allowing both direct and indirect comparison of the seven drugs. We considered dopamine agonists and MAO-B inhibitors given as monotherapy or in combination with levodopa. Selected endpoints were change in the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) score, serious adverse events and withdrawals. We estimated the relative effectiveness of each dopamine agonist and MAO-B inhibitor versus comparator drug. Results: Altogether, 79 publications were included in the analysis. We found all the investigated drugs to be effective compared with placebo when given as monotherapy except safinamide. When considering combination treatment, the estimated relative effects of selegiline, pramipexole, ropinirole, rotigotine, cabergoline, rasagiline and safinamide were 2.316 (1.819, 2.951), 2.091 (1.889, 2.317), 2.037 (1.804, 2.294), 1.912 (1.716, 2.129), 1.664 (1.113, 2.418), 1.584 (1.379, 1.820) and 1.179 (1.031, 1.352), respectively, compared with joint placebo and levodopa treatment. Conclusions: Dopamine agonists were found to be effective as treatment for Parkinson's disease, both when given as monotherapy and in combination with levodopa.

Researchers performed a thorough review of published studies to identify clinical trials investigating 4 dopamine agonists and 3 MAO-B inhibitors for Parkinson's disease. Data are pulled together from the published studies in a computer analysis that allows different comparisons of the 7 drugs. Researchers created the model to include dopamine agonists and MAO-B inhibitors being given as single therapy (only one drug used) or in combination with levodopa. The main outcomes (results) are Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores (rating tool used to measure the severity and progression of Parkinson's disease in patients), serious adverse events (unfavorable or unintended changes in health), and withdrawals (symptoms after a person stops taking a drug). The effectiveness of each dopamine agonist and MAO-B inhibitor versus a comparison drug is estimated. Altogether, 79 published studies are included in the analysis. All the investigated drugs are effective compared with placebos (inactive substances that look like the drug being tested in the experiment) when given as single therapy (the only drug given) except the MAO-B inhibitor, safinamide. In conclusion, dopamine agonists are found to be effective as treatment for Parkinson's disease, both when given in a single therapy and in combination with levodopa.

19,32628600,"A vast advancement has been made in the treatment related to central nervous system disorders especially Parkinson's disease. The development in therapeutics and a better understanding of the targets results in upsurge of many promising therapies for Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease is defined by neuronal degeneration and neuroinflammation and it is reported that the presence of the neurofibrillary aggregates such as Lewy bodies is considered as the marker. Along with this, it is also characterized by the presence of motor and non-motor symptoms, as seen in Parkinsonian patients. A lot of treatment options mainly focus on prophylactic measures or the symptomatic treatment of Parkinson's disease. Neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration are the point of interest which can be exploited as a new target to emphasis on Parkinson's disease.

It is always suggested to use other drug therapies concomitantly with levodopa. A number of significant causes and therapeutic targets for Parkinson's disease have been identified in the last decade, here an attempt was made to highlight the most significant of them.

Second-generation antidepressants are the first-line option for pharmacological management of depression. Optimising their use is crucial in reducing the burden of depression; however, debate about their dose dependency and their optimal target dose is ongoing. We have aimed to summarise the currently available best evidence to inform this clinical question. Findings: 28 554 records were identified through our search (24 524 published and 4030 unpublished records). 561 published and 121 unpublished full-text records were assessed for eligibility, and 77 studies were included (19 364 participants; mean age 42·5 years, SD 11·0; 7156 [60·9%] of 11 749 reported were women). For SSRIs (99 treatment groups), the dose-efficacy curve showed a gradual increase up to doses between 20 mg and 40 mg fluoxetine equivalents, and a flat to decreasing trend through the higher licensed doses up to 80 mg fluoxetine equivalents. Dropouts due to adverse effects increased steeply through the examined range. The relationship between the dose and dropouts for any reason indicated optimal acceptability for the SSRIs in the lower licensed range between 20 mg and 40 mg fluoxetine equivalents. Venlafaxine (16 treatment groups) had an initially increasing dose-efficacy relationship up to around 75-150 mg, followed by a more modest increase, whereas for mirtazapine (11 treatment groups) efficacy increased up to a dose of about 30 mg and then decreased. Both venlafaxine and mirtazapine showed optimal acceptability in the lower range of their licensed dose. These results were robust to several sensitivity analyses. Interpretation: For the most commonly used second-generation antidepressants, the lower range of the licensed dose achieves the optimal balance between efficacy, tolerability, and acceptability in the acute treatment of major depression.","Depression is the single largest contributor to non-fatal health loss worldwide. New antidepressants, also called second-generation antidepressants, (medications used to treat depression and other disorders and can improve mood, sleep quality, and concentration) are the first-line option for managing depression using medication. Their use is important to reduce the burden of depression; however, there is ongoing debate about their dose dependency (when the effects of a drug change when the dose of the drug is changed) and the best target dose (the dose that achieves a target effect). We have aimed to summarize the best available evidence to inform this clinical question. Researchers found 28,554 records by searching published and unpublished records. Among those records, 561 published and 121 unpublished records that have complete text are reviewed, and 77 are included in the final analysis. For SSRIs or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (a type of antidepressant that can increase the amount of serotonin, a mood stabilizer), the dose-efficacy curve (relationship between an effect of a drug and the amount of drug given) showed a gradual increase up to doses between 20mg and 40mg fluoxetine (a type of SSRI also called prozac), and a flat to decreasing trend through the higher doses up to 80 mg fluoxetine equivalents. Some patients dropped out due to side effects. The relationship between the dose of the drug and dropouts for any reason suggests the best acceptability for using SSRIs is in the lower licensed range between 20 mg and 40 mg fluoxetine equivalents. Venlafaxine (a type of antidepressant) has an initially increasing relationship between dose amount and drug performance up to 75-150mg, followed by a more modest increase, whereas for another antidepressant called mirtazapine, performance increased up to a dose of about 30 mg and then decreased. Both venlafaxine and mirtazapine worked well in the lower range of their licensed dose. These results performed well in several sensitivity analyses to assess strength and uncertainty in a study. For the most common newer antidepressants, the lower range of the dose achieves the best balance between performance, tolerability (the degree to which drugs' negative effects can be handled by patients), and acceptability in the treatment of major depression.",1,C
20,7852252,"Background: Although several studies have examined the long-term efficacy of antidepressants, relatively little attention has been paid to the management of relapses or recurrences during continued antidepressant treatment. This study examined whether depressed patients who had recovered and then relapsed on fluoxetine 20 mg/day would benefit from an increase in fluoxetine dose. Method: Eighteen patients who relapsed on fluoxetine 20 mg/day during long-term treatment with fluoxetine as part of a placebo-controlled study had their fluoxetine dose raised to 40 mg/day and were followed for at least 1 month (mean time = 4.7 months). Results: Twelve (67%) were full responders, 3 (17%) partial responders, and 3 (17%) dropped out because of side effects (e.g., insomnia and agitation). Of those patients who had either full or partial response (N = 15; 83%), 3 complete responders had a recurrence on 40 mg/day after a mean of 5.8 months and 1 partial responder had a recurrence 11 months later. Overall, 11 (61%) of 18 patients maintained their response during their follow-up while taking the higher dose of fluoxetine. Conclusion: An increase in dose of fluoxetine to 40 mg/day appears to be an effective strategy in the treatment of relapse among depressed patients who had initially responded to fluoxetine 20 mg/day.","Antidepressants are medications used to treat depression and other disorders and can improve mood, sleep quality, and concentration. Although several studies have examined how well antidepressants work long-term, there is little attention on how to manage relapses (the worsening of a medical condition that had previously improved) or recurrences (when symptoms return months or years after a person has recovered from the last episode) during continued use of antidepressant drugs. This study examined whether depressed patients who had recovered and then relapsed on fluoxetine (a type of antidepressant also called prozac) at 20 mg/day will benefit from an increase dose of fluoxetine. In this study, 18 patients who relapsed on fluoxetine 20 mg/day during long-term treatment with fluoxetine as part of a larger study had their fluoxetine dose raised to 40 mg/day and were followed for at least 1 month. Twelve (67%) were full responders (patients who reached the expected improvement), 3 (17%) partial responders (patients who reached only part of the expected improvement), and 3 (17%) dropped out of the study because of side effects (e.g. insomnia and agitation). Of those 15 patients who had either full or partial response, 3 complete responders had a recurrence on 40 mg/day after an average of 5.8 months and 1 partial responder had a recurrence 11 months later. Overall, 11 (61%) of 18 patients still reacted to the drug during their follow-up while taking the higher dose of fluoxetine. In conclusion, an increase in dose of fluoxetine to 40 mg/day appears to be an effective way to help treat relapse among people with depression who had initially responded to fluoxetine at 20 mg/day.",1,C

20,12097783,"Objective: Although continuing antidepressant treatment after patients have responded to medication has been shown to greatly reduce the risk of relapse, this risk is not eliminated. A number of theories have been proposed to account for this apparent loss of efficacy. A common initial approach to managing relapse is to increase the dose of antidepressant. We prospectively evaluated the likelihood of response to increasing the fluoxetine doses in patients relapsing during a long-term efficacy study of two fluoxetine dosing regimens. Method: Patients meeting the DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder with modified HAMD17 scores > or =18 and CGI-severity scores > or =4 were treated for 13 weeks with open-label 20 mg/day fluoxetine in a multicenter US study. Responders (n = 501) were randomized to 20 mg fluoxetine daily, placebo, or 90 mg enteric-coated fluoxetine weekly for 25 weeks of double-blind continuation treatment. If the patients relapsed during the continuation phase, they were offered a 25-week optional rescue treatment phase during which the study medication dose was increased as follows: (1) patients on placebo had treatment with fluoxetine 20 mg/day reinitiated, (2) patients on fluoxetine 20 mg/day had their dose increased to 40 mg/day, and (3) patients on a 90-mg weekly dose had their dose increased to 90 mg twice a week. The results of the rescue phase for the latter two groups who relapsed while on continuation treatment with fluoxetine are reported. Response was defined as a 50% reduction in the modified HAMD17 score since time of relapse and a CGI-severity score < or =2. Additional efficacy analyses included HAMD and CGI-severity changes from baseline to endpoint. Safety measures included assessment of treatment-emergent adverse events, vital signs, and laboratory measures. Results: Overall, patients relapsing during the continuation treatment responded to an increased dose (57% of the 40-mg-daily group and 72% of the enteric-coated 90-mg-twice-weekly group). Mean modified HAMD17 scores decreased from a mean of approximately 20 to below 8 and were maintained for up to 6 months in the responders. Thirty-five percent of patients either did not respond or initially responded but again relapsed after augmentation of medication. Conclusions: The patients relapsing after initially responding to fluoxetine can benefit from an increase in fluoxetine dose. These results also generally support increasing dose as a first-line treatment strategy for a patient who has relapsed while taking a previously effective dose of an antidepressant. Increasing enteric-coated fluoxetine 90 mg once weekly to twice weekly appeared to be as well-tolerated and effective in restoring response as increasing a daily fluoxetine dose from 20 to 40 mg.","Continuing treatment with antidepressants after patients have responded to medication has been shown to greatly reduce the risk of relapse, which is when a medical condition that had previously improved starts to worsen. However, the risk of a relapse is not completely eliminated. A number of theories have been suggested to account for this possible decline in how well antidepressant medicines work. A common first approach to help a patient who is relapsing is to increase the dose of the antidepressant medicine. Researchers evaluated the chance patients will respond to an increase in the dose of fluoxetine (a type of antidepressant also called prozac) in patients relapsing during a long-term study of two different dosing plans of fluoxetine. Patients who have major depressive disorder are treated for 13 weeks with 20 mg/day of fluoxetine in a large US study. The 501 patients who responded to the medicine are randomly put into either the group receiving 20 mg/day of fluoxetine, the group receiving sham treatment that has the appearance of the drug but is not the real medicine, or 90 mg of fluoxetine weekly. They will be in these groups for 25 weeks during a part of the study called the continuation phase. If the patients relapse during the continuation phase, they are offered a different 25-week treatment plan called a rescue phase where the study medication dose is increased as 1) patients on placebo will restart fluoxetine at 20 mg/day, 2) patients on fluoxetine 20 mg/day will have their dose increased to 40 mg/day, and 3) patients on the 90-mg weekly dose will have their dose increased to 90-mg twice a week. The results of the rescue phase the patients in group 2 (who received 20 mg/day) and group 3 (who received the 90-mg weekly). Researchers used scoring tools that measure depression severity and seeing how much the depression scores are reduced since the time of the last relapse. Additional analyses to evaluate how well the medicine worked include changes in these scoring tools from the start of the study to the end. Safety checks include assessment of unexpected side effects, vital signs (e.g. blood pressure, temperature), and tests done in a lab. Overall, patients relapsing during the continuation treatment phase responded to an increased dose (57% of the 40-mg-daily group and 72% of the 90-mg-twice-weekly group). The average score of the tool that measure depression severity decreased and was maintained for up to 6 months in the people who responded. There are 35 patients who either did not respond or responded at first but then relapsed after increasing medication. In conclusion, patients who relapsed after first responding to fluoxetine can benefit from an increase in the dose amount of fluoxetine. These results also generally support increasing the dose as a first-line treatment plan for a patient who has relapsed while taking a previously effective dose of an antidepressant. Increasing fluoxetine 90 mg once weekly to twice weekly appears to have side effects that patients can handle and is just as effective in restoring response as when daily fluoxetine dose is increased from 20 mg to 40 mg.",1,C
20,1378369,"Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are a recently developed class of drugs with significantly greater antidepressant efficacy than placebo. Generally, in double-blind comparative trials, all SSRIs demonstrated antidepressant efficacy similar to that of the 'standard' tricyclic antidepressants amitriptyline and imipramine; a meta-analysis of controlled trials found the efficacy of the SSRIs to be equivalent to that of the 2 tricyclics. Nevertheless, because of small patient numbers included in most studies that compare SSRIs with other antidepressants, no definitive statements about relative efficacy can be made. In these studies it is simply possible to state that no statistically significant differences were identified between SSRIs and the comparative antidepressants. Importantly, differences in clinical characteristics exist between the SSRIs-differences in elimination half-life (t1/2 beta) between fluoxetine and/or its metabolite (total t1/2 beta = 330 hours) and other SSRIs (t1/2 beta range = 15 to 30 hours), for example. This has implications in terms of potential drug interactions and must be considered when patients have to be switched to treatment with monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Studies with fluvoxamine have been conducted in both in- and outpatients, whereas trials with other SSRIs have been confined largely to outpatient populations. Fluvoxamine has been associated with a high incidence of nausea (37%), although this may have resulted from high initial dosages (rather than upward dose titration protocols) used in early trials. Of further interest, fluoxetine doses of 20mg may be sufficient to produce a satisfactory antidepressant response, and this SSRI may be particularly useful in patients with chronic retarded depression. More clinical data are required before the efficacy of sertraline and citalopram relative to standard antidepressants can be clearly defined. Preliminary data indicate that SSRIs are effective in the treatment of panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), eating (e.g. anorexia and bulimia) and personality disorders (e.g. anger, impulsiveness) and substance abuse (e.g. alcoholism); early results with fluvoxamine in the treatment of panic disorder and OCD, and with fluoxetine in the treatment of bulimia, personality disorders and alcohol abuse, have been encouraging. SSRIs have a more favourable tolerability profile than tricyclic antidepressants and, unlike the tricyclics, are not associated with anticholinergic adverse effects, sedation, cardiotoxicity or weight gain. SSRIs are associated with a relatively high incidence of nausea, particularly if high doses are used at the start of treatment. However, the incidence of nausea appears to decrease as treatment is continued.","Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are a recently developed type of drugs that works better as an antidepressant than a placebo, a type of substance that looks like a real pill but is not the real medicine. In clinical studies, all SSRIs showed that they have similar effectiveness as standard antidepressants that are older types of medicines. However, because of the small patient numbers in most studies that compare SSRIs with other antidepressants, no definite statements on how the effectiveness compares between the two types of drugs can be made. In these studies, it is simply possible to state that no significant differences based on data analysis are identified between SSRIs and the other type of antidepressants they are being compared to. Importantly, differences in medical features and measures exist between the SSRIs, including differences in the time it takes for the amount of the drug in the body to be reduced to half its starting amount between fluoxetine (a type of antidepressant also called prozac) and other SSRIs. The findings from these existing studies may lead to other effects, including how two or more drugs react to one another which must be considered when patients are switched to treatment with an earlier antidepressant. The structure of clinical studies differs between fluvoxamine, which includes inpatients and outpatients, and other SSRIs which mainly take place in outpatient settings. Fluvoxamine is associated with a high frequency of nausea (37%), although this may be the result from patients starting with a high dose that are often used in early trials instead of the standard dose. Additionally, fluoxetine doses of 20mg may be enough to produce a satisfactory antidepressant response, and this SSRI may be particularly useful in patients with chronic retarded depression, a depression disorder where symptoms include slow movement and toneless speech.

Patients are able to handle the side effects of SSRIs better than tricyclic antidepressants and, unlike the tricyclics, SSRIs are not associated with adverse effects of anticholinergic drugs that treat a number of health problems, sedation, damage to the heart, or weight gain.

SSRIs show similar success to other common antidepressants like amitriptyline and imipramine. Still, since the studies have small patient samples, no definite statements about the relative antidepressant success of SSRIs can be made. In these studies, no difference was identified between SSRIs and other antidepressants. Importantly, SSRIs have differences like effect duration among other antidepressant medications like fluoxetine. This distinct effect duration may alter the drug's success and should be considered when switching patients' treatments. Studies with fluvoxamine (an antidepressant SSRI) occured with patients in and out of hospitals, while studies with other SSRIs occured largely with patients out of hospitals. Using fluvoxamine (an antidepressant drug) may lead to nausea, but this may be due to using high starting doses rather than steadily-increasing dosages for use in early trials. 20 mg of flueoxetine may give a decent antidepressant response and be useful for those with long-lasting, movement-inhibiting depression. More data is needed to define the success of other antidepressant selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors like sertraline and citalopram. SSRIs like fluvoxamine and fluoxetine seem to help treat a variety of mental illnesses other than depression. Patients put up with SSRIs better than other non-SSRI antidepressants and without notable side effects, sleepiness, heart damage, or weight gain. SSRIs can lead to nausea, especially with high starting doses. However, the frequency of nausea may decrease as treatment continues.",2,C
20,33404081,"Objective: Since several recent meta-analyses report a dose-response relationship for the antidepressant effect of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), we investigated how these drugs are dosed in clinical practice. Methods: Through linkage of nation- or region-wide registers, we describe SSRI doses in 50,365 individuals residing in Region Västra Götaland, Sweden, with an incident diagnosis of depression and initiating SSRI treatment between 2007 and 2016. The primary question was to elucidate to what extent these individuals had been prescribed a daily dose that according to recent meta-analyses is required to elicit the maximum antidepressant effect, that is >20 mg citalopram, >10 mg escitalopram, >10 mg fluoxetine, >10 mg paroxetine or >50 mg sertraline. Results: In all, 21,049 (54%) out of 38,868 individuals <65 years of age, and 9,131 (79%) out of 11,497 individuals ≥65 years of age, never received an SSRI dose reported to exert maximum antidepressant effect. These prescribing practices were seen for citalopram, escitalopram and sertraline, but not for fluoxetine and paroxetine, and were frequent in both primary and secondary/tertiary care. Suggesting that doses here defined as maximum efficacy doses, when prescribed, are usually not intolerable, between 59% and 68% of individuals <65 years of age received such a dose also for the subsequent prescription, that is as frequently as in those prescribed a sub-maximum efficacy dose (52-69%). Conclusion: Most patients being prescribed an SSRI to treat their depression never receive the dose that according to recent meta-analyses is most likely to effectively combat their condition. The lack of consensus regarding effective dosing of SSRIs may have contributed to this state of affairs.","Several analyses using data from multiple studies have found a relationship between the amount of a medicine given (dose) and its effect in a type of antidepressant called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). The objective of this study is to investigate how these SSRI drugs are dosed in doctor's offices and health clinics. Researchers describe SSRI doses in 50,365 people living in a specific region in Sweden, with a diagnosis of depression and starting SSRI treatment between 2007 and 2016. The main question is to explain the extent these people are prescribed a daily dose that is expected to get a peak response that would not go higher with a higher dose, which is > 20 mg of citalopram, >10 mg escitalopram, >10 mg fluoxetine, >10 mg paroxetine or >50 mg sertraline - all SSRIs. Overall, 21,049 (54%) out of 38,868 individuals <65 years of age, and 9,131 (79%) out of 11,497 individuals ≥65 years of age, never receive an SSRI dose reported to bring about a maximum antidepressant effect. These dosing practices are seen for citalopram, escitalopram and sertraline, but not for fluoxetine and paroxetine, and are frequent in both general care and specialized care. Between 59% and 68% of individuals <65 years of age received the maximum efficacy dose (the dose where an increased dose given would not lead to improvement) for the next prescription. That percent is as frequently as in those prescribed a sub-maximum efficacy dose which is the dose that has a lower response despite an increase in the dose amount. In conclusion, most patients taking an SSRI to treat their depression never receive the dose that is most likely to effectively fight their condition based on detailed reviews of available data.

20,19445546,"Pediatric generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is characterized by excessive and uncontrollable worry about a variety of events and is accompanied by physical symptoms such as headaches, tension, restlessness, gastrointestinal distress, and heart palpitations. Symptoms impose marked distress and interfere with social, emotional, and educational functioning. GAD occurs in over 10% of children and adolescents, has an average age of onset of 8.5 years, and is more often reported in girls. Common co-occurring conditions include separation anxiety disorder and social phobia. Assessment involves a multi-informant, multi-method approach involving the child, parents, and school teachers. A clinical interview should be conducted to assess for the three primary ways anxiety presents: behaviors, thoughts, and somatic symptoms. Several semi-structured diagnostic interviews are available, and the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule is increasingly used. Rating scales completed by the patient, caregivers, and teachers provide useful information for diagnosis and symptom monitoring. Several scales are available to assess patients for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th Edition) GAD diagnosis; however, instruments generally cannot distinguish children with GAD from children with similar anxiety disorders. Both cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have demonstrated efficacy for the treatment of pediatric anxiety disorders including GAD. Evidence suggests that the combination of CBT plus sertraline offers additional benefit compared with either treatment alone. With pharmacotherapy, systematic tracking of treatment-emergent adverse events such as headaches, stomach aches, behavioral activation, worsening symptoms, and emerging suicidal thoughts is important. Recommended starting doses are fluvoxamine 25 mg/day, fluoxetine 10 mg/day, and sertraline 25 mg/day, though lower starting doses are possible. Dosing can be adjusted as often as weekly with the goal of achieving a high-quality response, while minimizing side effects. Long-term treatment with medication has not been well studied; however, to achieve optimal long-term outcome extended use of medication may be required. It is recommended to continue medication for approximately 1 year following remission in symptoms, and when discontinuing medication to choose a stress-free time of the year. If symptoms return, medication re-initiation should be considered seriously.","In children, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) includes having more than normal and uncontrollable worry about different events and is also includes physical symptoms such as headaches, tension, restlessness, digestive problems, and a racing heartbeat. Symptoms interfere with social, emotional, and educational experiences. GAD occurs in over 10% of children and adolescents and usually starts at the age of 8.5 years. GAD is more often reported in girls. Common conditions that occur with GAD include getting very anxious when separated from family or the main caregiver and social phobia, an intense fear of being in front of others or being watched or judged. Multiple methods are used to test for GAD and includes the child, parents, and school teachers. An interview is recommended to look for the three main ways anxiety is shown: behaviors, thoughts, and somatic (physical) symptoms. Several interview formats to make a diagnosis are available. The Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule is increasingly used. Ratings scales are completed by the patient, caregivers, and teachers and provide useful information for diagnosis and symptom monitoring. Several scales are able to make a GAD diagnosis which is a diagnosis based on the well-known handbook of mental disorders used by many providers; however, interview tools usually cannot make the distinction between children with GAD and children with similar anxiety disorders. Cognitive-behavioral therapy, which is a type of therapy that focuses on challenging negative thoughts that can worsen emotional difficulties, is shown to be a part positive effect for the treatment of GAD. Additionally, a type of antidepressant called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) also show benefits for the treatment of pediatric anxiety disorders including GAD. Evidence suggests that the combination of cognitive-behavioral therapy plus sertraline (an SSRI medication) offers additional benefit when compared with either treatment alone. When using medications for treatment, it is important to monitor and track negative side effects that occur such as headaches, stomach aches, behavioral activation, worsening symptoms, and emerging suicidal thoughts. Recommended starting doses of SSRIs are fluvoxamine 25 mg/day, fluoxetine 10 mg/day, and sertraline 25 mg/day, though starting with lower doses is possible. Dosing can be changed as often as weekly with the goal of achieving a high-quality response, while minimizing side effects. Long-term treatment with medication has not been well studied; however, to reach the best long-term outcome, extended use of the medication may be required. It is recommended to continue medication for about 1 year after remission in symptoms, and to choose a stress-free time of the year when stopping medication. If symptoms return, restarting the medication should be considered seriously.",1,C

20,10917403,"Fluoxetine (FLX) has a unique pharmacokinetic profile. Its major metabolite, norfluoxetine (NFLX), possesses FLX's antidepressant efficacy and a half-life of 7 to 15 days, suggesting the possibility of nonstandard dosing strategies. This study examined the tolerability of a weekly dose and its equivalence to daily dosing of FLX for the continuation phase of treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD). One hundred fourteen subjects initially received open-label treatment with 20 mg of FLX daily for 7 weeks. Subsequently, 70 subjects with a score on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) of 12 or less were randomly assigned in a double-blind design to one of three treatment groups: 20 mg FLX daily (N = 21), 60 mg FLX weekly (N = 28), or placebo (N = 21) and were followed for 7 weeks. HAM-D scores and blood levels of FLX and NFLX were analyzed using a repeated-measures analysis of variance. During the double-blind phase, blood levels for both FLX and NFLX differed across the treatment groups, yet no statistically significant difference in HAM-D scores was observed. There was no difference in the dropout rate across the groups. Subjects could not correctly identify the treatment group into which they were assigned. Weekly dosing of FLX seems to be well tolerated and possibly as effective as daily dosing in maintaining the therapeutic response in subjects with MDD.","Fluoxetine is a type of antidepressant that is also called prozac. There is the possibility that fluoxetine can be given to patients in dose amounts that is different from the regular doses of other medications. In order to study the treatment for major depressive disorder, this study examined how well patients handled a weekly dose of fluoxetine and then monitored the same amount but given daily during a following phase of the study. In this study, 114 patients first receive treatment with 20 mg of fluoxetine daily for 7 weeks. Next, 70 patients are randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: 20 mg fluoxetine daily with 21 subjects, 60 mg fluoxetine weekly with 28 patients, or placebo of an inactive substance that looks like the drug with 21patients and are followed for 7 weeks. Scores for depression using a rating scale and blood levels of fluoxetine and norfluoxetine, another form of fluoxetine, are analyzed.

21,33064426,"Groin hernias are caused by a defect of the abdominal wall in the groin area and comprise inguinal and femoral hernias. Inguinal hernias are more common in men. Although groin hernias are easily diagnosed on physical examination in men, ultrasonography is often needed in women. Ultrasonography is also helpful when a recurrent hernia, surgical complication after repair, or other cause of groin pain (e.g., groin mass, hydrocele) is suspected. Magnetic resonance imaging has higher sensitivity and specificity than ultrasonography and is useful for diagnosing occult hernias if clinical suspicion is high despite negative ultrasound findings. Herniography, which involves injecting contrast media into the hernial sac, may be used in selected patients. Becoming familiar with the common types of surgical interventions can help family physicians facilitate postoperative care and assess for complications, including recurrence. Laparoscopic repair is associated with shorter recovery time, earlier resumption of activities of daily living, less pain, and lower recurrence rates than open repair. Watchful waiting is a reasonable and safe option in men with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic inguinal hernias. Watchful waiting is not recommended in patients with symptomatic hernias or in nonpregnant women.","Digestive organs (e.g., intestines) coming out through a weak point or tear in the abdomen causes groin hernias and includes inguinal (groin area) and femoral (upper thigh area) hernias. Inguinal hernias happen more in men. Although groin hernias are easily seen in a physical exam in men, ultrasound is often needed in women. Ultrasound is also helpful when a doctor thinks a hernia has returned, there is a complication after surgery to repair the hernia, or there is another cause of pain (e.g., groin mass, fluid collection in the scrotum). MRI has higher accuracy for detection and no detection than ultrasound and is useful for diagnosing hidden hernias if a doctor thinks it is hernia even if an ultrasound does not show one. Injecting a substance into the hernia sac to improve visibility in x-rays may be used in some patients. Learning about the common types of surgeries can help family doctors improve care after surgery and look for complications, including the hernia returning. Minimally invasive repair has a shorter recovery time, earlier return to daily activities, less pain, and lower return rates than traditional repair. Men with inguinal hernias and with few to no symptoms can reasonably and safely watch the hernia without treatment unless symptoms appear or change. Watching without treatment unless symptoms appear or change is not suggested in people with hernias with symptoms or in nonpregnant women.",1,C

Results: Asymptomatic hiatal and paraesophageal hernias become symptomatic and necessitate repair at a rate of 1% per year. Watchful waiting is appropriate for asymptomatic hernias. Symptomatic hiatal hernias and those with confirmed reflux disease require operative repair with an anti-reflux procedure. Key operative steps include the following: reduction and excision of hernia sac, 3 cm of intraabdominal esophageal length, crural closure with mesh reinforcement, and an anti-reflux procedure. Repairs not amenable to key steps may undergo gastropexy and gastrostomy placement as an alternative procedure. Conclusions: Hiatal hernias are commonly incidental findings.

Surgery is the appropriate treatment of complicated LH that is an extremely rare condition with approximately 50 cases reported in the literature over the past 300 years. Case presentation: A 46-year-old Caucasian female was admitted to the Emergency Department with a two-day history of abdominal pain. Physical examination revealed an irreducible and painfull mass in umbilical region. Abdominal computed tomography scan showed the protrusion of greater omentum and small bowel loop through the umbilical ring. Laboratory tests were unremarkable. After diagnosis of strangulated umbilical hernia, the patient underwent exploratory laparotomy: the irreducible umbilical hernial sac was opened with presence of incarcerated and strangulated omentum and uncomplicated MD. Resection of incarcerated and ischemic greater omentum alone was performed. The postoperative course of patient was uneventful. Clinical discussion: Meckel's diverticulum (MD) is a vestigial remnant of the omphalomesenteric duct, representing the most common congenital malformation of the gastrointestinal tract. Preoperative diagnosis of LH is very difficult and surgery represents the correct treatment of complicated LH.

21,18656819,"Hiatus hernia refers to conditions in which elements of the abdominal cavity, most commonly the stomach, herniate through the oesophageal hiatus into the mediastinum. With the most common type (type I or sliding hiatus hernia) this is associated with laxity of the phrenooesophageal membrane and the gastric cardia herniates. Sliding hiatus hernia is readily diagnosed by barium swallow radiography, endoscopy, or manometry when greater than 2 cm in axial span. However, the mobility of the oesophagogastric junction precludes the reliable detection of more subtle disruption by endoscopy or radiography. Detecting lesser degrees of axial separation between the lower oesophageal sphincter and crural diaphragm can only be reliably accomplished with high-resolution manometry, a technique that permits real time localization of these oesophagogastric junction components without swallow or distention related artefact.","Hiatus hernia refers to when the upper part of the stomach pushes up through the diaphragm into the chest. The most common type (type 1 or sliding hiatus hernia), looseness of the ligament that attaches the esophagus to the diaphragm, causes the part of the stomach that is closest to the esophagus to push up. Sliding hiatus hernia is easily diagnosed by a swallowing test during x-ray, a flexible tube with a light and camera attached, or an esophagus test when more than 2 cm along an axis. However, the movement of the junction between the esophagus and stomach doesn't allow for dependable detection of smaller abnormalities using a flexible tube with a light and camera attached or x-ray.

In parallel, PKU was for a long time considered to be an excellent test system for experimental gene therapy of a Mendelian autosomal recessive defect of the liver due to an outstanding mouse model and the easy to analyze and well-defined therapeutic end point, that is, blood l-phenylalanine concentration. Lifelong treatment by targeting the mouse liver (or skeletal muscle) was achieved using different approaches, including (1) recombinant adeno-associated viral (rAAV) or nonviral naked DNA vector-based gene addition, (2) genome editing using base editors delivered by rAAV vectors, and (3) by delivering rAAVs for promoter-less insertion of the PAH-cDNA into the Pah locus. In this article we summarize the gene therapeutic attempts of correcting a mouse model for PKU and discuss the future implications for human gene therapy.","Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a model of a disorder controlled by a single gene in which the body cannot properly turn some food into energy. However, scientists didn't consider transferring genetic material into a PKU patient's cells due to other working treatments. However, unexpected mental function improvements after long-term treatment of adults with PKU by substituting a substance that is lacking in the PKU patient's body might change this belief. In the same way, PKU was thought to be a great test for trying to transfer genetic material into a patient's cells to help a liver disorder inherited from both parents due to a great mouse model and measurable blood levels of l-phenylalanine (a substance transformed by the missing protein in PKU). Lifelong treatment by focusing on the mouse liver (or skeletal muscle) was done using three different approaches.

Early diagnosis is based on newborn screening, and if treatment is started early and continued, intelligence is within normal limits with, on average, some suboptimal neurocognitive function.

The actual extent of use of these agents in clinical practice is unknown, however. Methods: Using a database with information from encounters with general practitioners (GP) in Germany, we identified all patients, aged > or =65 years, with any GP office visits or dispensed prescriptions with a diagnosis of GAD (ICD-10 diagnosis code F41.1) between 10/1/2003 and 9/30/2004 (""GAD patients""). Among GAD-related medications (including benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs], selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, venlafaxine, hydroxyzine, buspirone, pregabalin, and trifluoperazine), long-acting benzodiazepines, selected short-acting benzodiazepines at relatively high dosages, selected TCAs, and hydroxyzine were designated ""potentially inappropriate"" for use in patients aged > or = 65 years, based on published criteria. Results: A total of 975 elderly patients with GAD were identified. Mean age was 75 years, and 72% were women; 29% had diagnoses of comorbid depression. Forty percent of study subjects received potentially inappropriate agents - most commonly, bromazepam (10% of all subjects), diazepam (9%), doxepin (7%), amitriptyline (5%), and lorazepam (5%). Twenty-three percent of study subjects received long-acting benzodiazepines, 10% received short-acting benzodiazepines at relatively high doses, and 12% received TCAs designated as potentially inappropriate. Conclusion: GPs in Germany often prescribe medications that have been designated as potentially inappropriate to their elderly patients with GAD - especially those with comorbid depressive disorders. Further research is needed to ascertain whether there are specific subgoups of elderly patients with GAD for whom the benefits of these medications outweigh their risks.","Many drugs often used to treat generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) have been labeled ""potentially inappropriate"" for use in patients 65-years-old and above because they may cause more risks than benefits. However, it is not known how often these drugs are given to patients. From a database of patients in Germany, we identified all patients 65-years-old and above with GAD who had seen a primary care doctor or received a prescription between 10/1/2003 and 9/30/2004. Among drugs to treat GAD (including benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs], SSRIs, venlafaxine, hydroxyzine, buspirone, pregabalin, and trifluoperazine), long-acting benzodiazepines, some short-acting benzodiazepines at relatively high doses, some TCAs, and hydroxyzine were categorized ""potentially inappropriate"" for people 65-years-old and above. We looked at 975 elderly patients with GAD. Average age was 75 years, and 72% were women; 29% were also diagnosed with depression. Forty percent of people in the study were given inappropriate anxiety-treating drugs - most often, bromazepam (10% of all subjects), diazepam (9%), doxepin (7%), amitriptyline (5%), and lorazepam (5%). Twenty-three percent of people in the study were given long-acting benzodiazepines, 10% were given short-acting benzodiazepines at relatively high doses, and 12% were given TCAs categorized as potentially inappropriate. We conclude that German doctors often prescribe drugs labeled as potentially inappropriate to their elderly patients with GAD, especially those also diagnosed with depression.

24,16733942,"A drug interaction refers to an event in which the usual pharmacological effect of a drug is modified by other factors, most frequently additional drugs. When two drugs are administered simultaneously, or within a short time of each other, an interaction can occur that may increase or decrease the intended magnitude or duration of the effect of one or both drugs. Drugs may interact on a pharmaceutical, pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic basis. Pharmacodynamic interactions arise when the alteration of the effects occurs at the site of action. This is a wide field where not only interactions between different drugs are considered but also drug and metabolites (midazolam/alpha-hydroxy-midazolam), enantiomers (ketamine), as well as phenomena such as tolerance (nordiazepam) and sensitization (diazepam). Pharmacodynamic interactions can result in antagonism or synergism and can originate at a receptor level (antagonism, partial agonism, down-regulation, up-regulation), at an intraneuronal level (transduction, uptake), or at an interneuronal level (physiological pathways). Alternatively, psychotropic drug interactions assessed through quantitative pharmaco-EEG can be viewed according to the broad underlying objective of the study: safety-oriented (ketoprofen/theophylline, lorazepam/diphenhydramine, granisetron/haloperidol), strictly pharmacologically-oriented (benzodiazepine receptors), or broadly neuro-physiologically-oriented (diazepam/buspirone). Methodological issues are stressed, particularly drug plasma concentrations, dose-response relationships and time-course of effects (fluoxetine/buspirone), and unsolved questions are addressed (yohimbine/caffeine, hydroxizyne/alcohol).","A drug interaction is when other things change the usual effects of a drug, most often other drugs. When two drugs are taken at the same time, or within a short time of each other, an interaction can happen that may change the size or length of the effect of one or both drugs. Drugs may interact based on what the drugs do to each other (pharmaceutical), what the body does to the drugs (pharmacokinetic), and what the drugs do to the body (pharmacodynamic). Pharmacodynamic interactions occur when the change in effect happens at the site the drug works at in the body. Phamacodynamics is a wide field. Pharmacodynamic interactions can cause drugs to work together or against each other and can happen at different levels of the body. Drugs that affect the mind, emotions, and behavior measured through a well known tool for finding and characterizing drug effects on the central nervous system (quantitative pharmaco-EEG) can be used based on the aim of the study: safety (ketoprofen/theophylline, lorazepam/diphenhydramine, granisetron/haloperidol), drug properties (benzodiazepine receptors), or brain function (diazepam/buspirone). We focus on methods, especially drug blood levels, response as a function of dosage, and varying activity of the drug over time (fluoxetine/buspirone) and talk about unsolved questions.",1,C
24,11097963,"Objective: Patients with generalized anxiety disorder (N=107) who had been long-term benzodiazepine users (average duration of use=8.5 years) were enrolled in a benzodiazepine discontinuation program that assessed the effectiveness of concomitant imipramine (180 mg/day) and buspirone (38 mg/day) compared to placebo in facilitating benzodiazepine discontinuation. Method: After a benzodiazepine stabilization period taking either diazepam, lorazepam, or alprazolam, patients were treated for 4 weeks with imipramine, buspirone, or placebo under double-blind conditions while benzodiazepine intake was kept stable (treatment phase). Patients then entered a 4-6 week benzodiazepine taper and a 5-week posttaper phase with imipramine, buspirone, and placebo treatment being continued until 3 weeks into the posttaper phase, at which time all patients were switched to placebo for 2 weeks. Benzodiazepine plasma levels were assayed weekly. Benzodiazepine-free status was assessed 3 and 12 months posttaper. Results: Study subjects were long-term benzodiazepine users with an average of three unsuccessful prior taper attempts. The success rate of the taper in this study was significantly higher for patients who received imipramine (82.6%), and nonsignificantly higher for patients who received buspirone (67.9%), than for patients who received placebo (37.5%). The imipramine effect remained highly significant even after the analysis adjusted for three other independent predictors of taper success: benzodiazepine dose, level of anxious symptoms at baseline, and duration of benzodiazepine therapy. Conclusions: Management of benzodiazepine discontinuation can be facilitated significantly by co-prescribing imipramine before and during the benzodiazepine taper. Daily benzodiazepine dose, severity of baseline symptoms of anxiety and depression, and duration of benzodiazepine use were additional significant predictors of successful taper outcome.","We enrolled 107 patients with generalized anxiety disorder who had been long-term benzodiazepine users (average length of use=8.5 years) in a program to discontinue benzodiazepines to measure how well other anxiety-reducing drugs like imipramine (180 mg/day) and buspirone (38 mg/day) helped patients wean or discontinue benzodiazepines compared to sugar pills. After a period to stabilize benzodiazepine levels taking either diazepam, lorazepam, or alprazolam, patients took imipramine, buspirone, or sugar pills for 4 weeks while the amount of benzodiazepines taken were kept the same (treatment phase). Patients then slowly decreased the amount of benzodiazepines taken for 4-6 weeks, took imipramine, buspirone, and sugar pills for the next 3 weeks, and then took sugar pills for 2 weeks. Blood benzodiazepine levels were measured weekly using a common lab test. We measured how many patients no longer had benzodiazepine in their blood 3 and 12 months after the last sugar pill. Study participants had used benzodiazepines for a long time and had tried an average of three times to decrease the amount of benzodiazepines taken. Patients who took imipramine were significantly more successful in decreasing the amount of benzodiazepines taken (82.6%), nonsignificantly more successful regarding patients who took buspirone (67.9%), than for patients who took sugar pills (37.5%). Imipramine helped even after factoring in other factors to weaning success: amount of benzodiazepines taken, level of anxious feelings prior to weaning, and how long benzodiazepines have been taken. We concluded that discontinuing benzodiazepines can be done more easily by giving patients imipramine before and during the process of slowly decreasing the amount of benzodiazepines taken over time. Amount of benzodiazepines taken daily, level of anxiety and depression prior to weaning, and how long benzodiazepines have been taken also predicted success of slowly decreasing the amount of benzodiazepines taken.",1,C

The program measured how antidepressant imipramine (180 mg/day) and anxiety-reducing busprione (38 mg/day) helps end benzodiazepine use compared to inactive treatment. After using either diazepam, lorazepam, or alprazolam (anxiety-reducing benzodiazepines) for a period of time, patients used imipramine, busprione, or an inactive placebo for 4 weeks while benzodiazepine usage was stable. For 4-6 weeks, patients lessened benzodiazepine use. Then, for 5 weeks, patients kept using imipramine, busiprone, and inactive treatment until 3 weeks in this 5-week phase, at which all patients switched to inactive treatment for 2 weeks. Benzodiazepine blood levels were measured weekly. Benzodiazepine-free status was checked 3 and 12 months after treatment. Patients were long-term benzodiazepine users with an average of three failed attempts to lessen drug use. Success rate for lessening drug use was higher for patients taking imipramine (82.6%) and not much higher for patients taking buspirone (67.9%) compared to patients taking the inactive placebo (37.5%). The imipramine effect was still high even after accounting for benzodiazepine dose, baseline level of anxious symptoms, and duration of benzodiazepine treatment. Ending benzodiazepine drug use can be helped by using imipramine before and during the period of benzodiazepine drug use reduction. Daily benzodiazepine dose, severity of starting symptoms of anxiety and depression, and length of benzodiazepine use help predict successful reduction of drug use.",2,C
24,9600581,"In this double-blind, placebo-controlled 10-week trial, the anxiolytic properties of the nonbenzodiazepine buspirone were compared with the benzodiazepine lorazepam and placebo in 125 outpatients with generalized anxiety disorder according to DSM-III. After a 3- to 7-day wash-out period, patients were allocated at random to receive orally 3 x 5 mg buspirone (n=58), 3 x 1 mg lorazepam (n=57), or placebo (n=10) over a 4-week period. The study also comprised a 2-week taper period and a 4-week placebo-control period to assess the stability of clinical improvement. The patient's clinical state was estimated on entry and at weekly intervals by general practitioners using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A) and Clinical Global Impression (CGI) assessment and by a self-rating scale (State Trait Anxiety Inventory X2=STAI-X2). Lorazepam treatment resulted in descriptively, but not significantly, greater improvement on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety during the whole treatment (week 0-4) and taper period (week 5, 6) than did buspirone. After treatment with active drugs had been discontinued, the 4-week placebo control period showed buspirone-treated patients to display a stability of clinical improvement, while the symptoms of lorazepam-treated patients worsened at week 7-10. Both buspirone and lorazepam were more efficacious in reducing anxiety symptoms than placebo during the treatment and taper period; however, in contrast to the active drugs (buspirone, lorazepam), patients of the placebo group showed further clinical improvement during the control period, especially in the HAM-A score, so differences between placebo and active drugs became smaller at the end of the study.","Over 10 weeks, we compared the anti-anxiety drug characteristics of the nonbenzodiazepine buspirone with the benzodiazepine lorazepam and sugar pills in 125 patients outside the hospital with generalized anxiety disorder based on the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. After a 3- to 7-day period for the body to eliminate drugs in the system, patients were randomly given 5 mg buspirone 3 times a day (58 patients), 1 mg lorazepam 3 times a day (57 patients), or sugar pills (10 patients) for four weeks. The study also included a 2-week period when drug amounts were slowly decreased and a 4-week period when all patients took sugar pills to measure the consistency of improvements in anxiety symptoms. Doctors estimated severity of anxiety symptoms at the beginning of the study and weekly using common questionnaires. Patients taking lorazepam showed slightly greater improvement in symptoms than those taking buspirone on one of the questionnaires during the whole treatment (weeks 0-4) and when drug amounts were slowly decreased (weeks 5,6), though not significantly. After patients stopped taking the studied drugs, the 4-week period when patients took sugar pills showed patients who took buspirone showed consistent improvements in anxiety symptoms, while patients who took lorazepam showed worse symptoms at weeks 7-10. Both buspirone and lorazepam worked better than sugar pills to improve anxiety symptoms during treatment and when drug amounts were slowly decreased. However, patients who took sugar pills showed improvements in anxiety symptoms when all patients took sugar pills, especially in one questionnaire, so differences between sugar pills and drugs became smaller at the end of the study.",1,C
24,10901839,"This multicentre study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and consequences of progressive or abrupt withdrawal of clobazam in the treatment of Generalized Anxiety Disorder in a double blind study in comparison to lorazepam and buspirone. 128 outpatients suffering from Generalized Anxiety Disorder according to DMS III criteria were included in the study and treated for three weeks. They were randomly divided into 4 groups: group 1: 32 patients receiving clobazam, abruptly withdrawn and replaced by a placebo; group 2: 29 patients receiving clobazam with progressive withdrawal over 3 weeks, clobazam being replaced by a placebo; group 3: 33 patients receiving lorazepam with progressive withdrawal over 3 weeks, lorazepam being replaced by a placebo; group 4: 34 patients receiving buspirone, abruptly withdrawn and replaced by a placebo. The dosages were increased progressively during the first week of treatment. At the end of this time, the patients received either 30 mg clobazam or 30 mg buspirone or 3 mg lorazepam daily. After the first week, the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS) showed a significant improvement in clobazam and lorazepam groups but not in buspirone group. All the drugs were equally effective after three weeks of treatment. The anti-anxiety activity persisted after withdrawal of the studied drug in the 4 groups, without any signs of rebound anxiety or withdrawal syndrome. No clinically relevant differences were found between the 4 groups regarding safety. The side-effects reported were mainly drowsiness in clobazam and lorazepam groups, nausea and headache in buspirone group. In conclusion, clobazam like lorazepam improved anxiety more quickly than buspirone; after 3 weeks of therapy, efficacy was comparable with the 3 drugs and persisted after treatment discontinuation.","We rated the effectiveness and effects of gradual or fast withdrawal of clobazam (a benzodiazepine which helps treat anxiety) in treating generalized anxiety disorder compared to lorazepam and buspirone, other anxiety-treating drugs. 128 patients with generalized anxiety disorder based on the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders participated in the study and received treatment for three weeks.

During the first 2 weeks of double-blind, randomized treatment (weeks 6 to 7), lorazepam was tapered off. During weeks 12 to 13, patients received single-blind placebo. Assessment included the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Zung and Eddy Self-Rating Scale of Anxiety Symptoms, the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, and the Rome Depression Inventory, completed at weeks 0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, and 13.

The benzodiazepine-withdrawal syndrome was evaluated through a 27-symptom checklist (Clinical-Rated Benzodiazepine Withdrawal Symptom Schedule) at weeks 0, 5, 6, 7, 11, and 13. The results showed that buspirone was more effective than placebo and comparable to lorazepam. Buspirone-treated patients showed no rebound anxiety or benzodiazepine-withdrawal syndrome compared with placebo.

24,8095725,"The respiratory and behavioral effects of the benzodiazepine receptor (BZR) inverse agonist ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCE) were determined alone and in combination with buspirone, lorazepam, flumazenil, and SR 95195 in rhesus monkeys. For the respiratory studies, one group of monkeys inhaled either air or 5% CO2 mixed in air according to a fixed alternating schedule; respiratory frequency and minute volume were monitored. For the behavioral studies, another group of monkeys responded under a fixed-ratio (FR 30) schedule of food presentation. The respiratory stimulant effects of beta-CCE in both air and 5% CO2 were enhanced by prior treatment with the 5-hydroxytryptamine1A (5-HT1A) partial agonist buspirone (0.03 and 0.3 mg/kg) and a weak BZR inverse agonist, SR 95195 (10.0 mg/kg). Coadministration of buspirone (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg) also potentiated the rate-decreasing effects of beta-CCE under the FR schedule. The BZR agonist lorazepam (3.0 mg/kg) and BZR antagonist flumazenil (1.0 mg/kg) attenuated the effects of beta-CCE on respiratory frequency and minute volume particularly under the 5% CO2 condition, and lorazepam (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg) and flumazenil (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg) attenuated the effects of beta-CCE on FR responding. These latter results show that the respiratory and behavioral effects of beta-CCE in rhesus monkeys are at least in part due to effects at BZRs. Moreover, the findings suggest either that coactivation of benzodiazepine and 5-HT1A sites lead to a greater than additive effect or that beta-CCE and buspirone share a common mechanism of action that is unrelated to the receptor at which BZR inverse agonists act.","We studied effects on breathing and behavior of the benzodiazepine receptor (BZR; a molecule that receives signals for a cell) inverse agonist (a drug that binds to the same receptor as an agonist or stimulating molecule but causes an opposite response) ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCE) alone and with the anxiety-reducing drugs of buspirone, lorazepam, flumazenil, and SR 95195 in monkeys. For the breathing-related studies, one group of monkeys breathed air or 5% CO2 mixed in air; breaths per minute and amount of gas breathed were measured. For the behavior studies, another group of monkeys responded to food given every thirty seconds. The increased breathing effects of beta-CCE in both air and 5% CO2 were increased by previously taking the drugs of 5-hydroxytryptamine1A (5-HT1A), partial agonist buspirone (0.03 and 0.3 mg/kg) and a weak BZR inverse agonist, SR 95195 (10.0 mg/kg). Taking buspirone (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg) at the same time also increased effects of beta-CCE under the food schedule. The BZR agonist lorazepam (3.0 mg/kg) and BZR antagonist flumazenil (1.0 mg/kg) reduced the effects of beta-CCE on breaths per minute and amount of gas breathed especially under the 5% CO2 condition. Lorazepam (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg) and flumazenil (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg) reduced the effects of beta-CCE on behavior responding on the food schedule. These latter results shows that effects on breathing and behavior of beta-CCE in monkeys are at least due to effects at BZRs. The results also suggest that benzodiazepine and 5-HT1A sites activated at the same time cause an effect greater than their individual effects or that beta-CCE and buspirone work similarly independent of the receptor where BZR inverse antagonists work.",1,C

Study selection: Trials randomising people with suspected, probable, or confirmed covid-19 to antiviral antibody therapies, blood products, or standard care or placebo. Paired reviewers determined eligibility of trials independently and in duplicate. Methods: After duplicate data abstraction, we performed random effects bayesian meta-analysis, including network meta-analysis for outcomes with sufficient data. We assessed risk of bias using a modification of the Cochrane risk of bias 2.0 tool. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using the grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE) approach. We meta-analysed interventions with ≥100 patients randomised or ≥20 events per treatment arm. Results: As of 21 July 2021, we identified 47 trials evaluating convalescent plasma (21 trials), intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) (5 trials), umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (5 trials), bamlanivimab (4 trials), casirivimab-imdevimab (4 trials), bamlanivimab-etesevimab (2 trials), control plasma (2 trials), peripheral blood non-haematopoietic enriched stem cells (2 trials), sotrovimab (1 trial), anti-SARS-CoV-2 IVIg (1 trial), therapeutic plasma exchange (1 trial), XAV-19 polyclonal antibody (1 trial), CT-P59 monoclonal antibody (1 trial) and INM005 polyclonal antibody (1 trial) for the treatment of covid-19. Patients with non-severe disease randomised to antiviral monoclonal antibodies had lower risk of hospitalisation than those who received placebo: casirivimab-imdevimab (odds ratio (OR) 0.29 (95% CI 0.17 to 0.47); risk difference (RD) -4.2%; moderate certainty), bamlanivimab (OR 0.24 (0.06 to 0.86); RD -4.1%; low certainty), bamlanivimab-etesevimab (OR 0.31 (0.11 to 0.81); RD -3.8%; low certainty), and sotrovimab (OR 0.17 (0.04 to 0.57); RD -4.8%; low certainty). They did not have an important impact on any other outcome. There was no notable difference between monoclonal antibodies.

No intervention, including antiviral antibodies, had an important impact on any outcome in patients with severe or critical covid-19, except casirivimab-imdevimab, which may reduce mortality in patients who are seronegative. Conclusion: In patients with non-severe covid-19, casirivimab-imdevimab probably reduces hospitalisation; bamlanivimab-etesevimab, bamlanivimab, and sotrovimab may reduce hospitalisation.

Published data from other studies is summarized on an ongoing basis and compares data from different medicines, including an analysis to fill in the gaps for studies that have limited data. The data sources for this summary are the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 and six Chinese databases that store data up to July 21, 2021. In clinical trials, people with suspected COVID-19 (person has symptoms and/or exposure to covid but is not tested), probable COVID-19 (person who has tested positive with other tests but not confirmatory test), or confirmed COVID-19 are randomly put into different treatment groups or a placebo, where they receive something that looks like a drug but is not active. Two reviewers determine if the different clinical studies will be included in the summary. After data are collected from the clinical studies, the data are analyzed. The confidence that the results in the studies are accurate is graded using an established process. Clinical trials with 100 or more patients or 20 or more events per treatment type are analyzed. As of July 21st 2021, 47 trials that evaluated different blood products and medicines, including monoclonal antibodies, are found. Patients with non-severe disease who receive antiviral monoclonal antibodies (medicines that may block the virus from attaching to human cells) have lower risk of being hospitalized than those who received placebo. Antiviral monoclonal antibodies did not have an important impact on any other outcome. There is no major difference between monoclonal antibodies. No other treatment intervention is found to have any meaningful effect on any outcome in patients with non-severe COVID-19. No intervention, including antiviral antibodies, has an important impact on any outcome in patients with severe or critical COVID-19, except casirivimab-imdevimab, which may reduce death in patients who had a negative blood test. In conclusion, patients with non-severe COVID-19, the drug casirivimab-imdevimab probably reduces hospital stays; bamlanivimab-etesevimab, bamlanivimab, and sotrovimab may reduce hospitalization.

25,34555986,"Introduction: Treatments for subjects with Covid-19 are required. One approach is neutralising monoclonal antibodies. Bamlanivimab and etesevimab are monoclonal antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Areas covered: This evaluation is of the phase 3 BLAZE-1 clinical trial, which was of bamlanivimab plus etesevimab in adult ambulatory participants with a risk factor for, and mild to moderate, Covid-19 illness. The primary outcome was Covid 19 related hospitalisation of ≥ 24 hours or death from any cause by day 29, and this occurred in 2.1% subjects in the bamlanivimab/etesevimab group, compared to 7.0% in the placebo group. Expert opinion: In the pandemic, the attempts by the FDA to shorten approval processes for medicines and by journals to make information available in a timely manner are admirable. However, these shortened processes made negotiating the details of BLAZE-1 and producing accurate and critical appraisals difficult. It seems to me, that if there are any benefits of bamlanivimab alone in Covid-19, they are not clear-cut. Bamlanivimab has limited effects against the beta and gamma variants and is not effective against the delta variant. Thus, the benefits of bamlanivimab/etesevimab in the phase 3 of the BLAZE-1 may be solely due to etesevimab, and this needs to be tested.","Treatments for people with COVID-19, a viral breathing-related disorder, are needed. One option is to use monoclonal antibodies, which are medicines that may block the virus that causes COVID-19 from attaching to human cells, making it more difficult for the virus to reproduce. Bamlanivimab and etesevimab are two types of monoclonal antibodies. This evaluation is of the 3rd phase of a clinical study called BLAZE that examines bamlanivimab plus etesevimab in adults. The main result researchers look for is COVID-19 related hospital stays that lasted at least 24 hours or death. This result occurred in 2.1% of patients in the bamlanivimab/etesevimab group, compared to 7.0% in the placebo group. Based on opinions of experts, the FDA's efforts to shorten the approval process for medicines and for medical journals to make information available is admirable. However, these shortened processes make the details of the BLAZE study and producing accurate reviews difficult. It seems that if there are any benefits for bamlanivimab alone in COVID-19, they are not clear-cut. Bamlanivimab has limited effects against the beta and gamma variants of COVID-19 and is not effective against the delta variant.

25,34552950,"Over 80 mAbs have been shown to block the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 S1 glycoprotein and its cellular receptor, thus neutralizing virus infectivity in vitro. Some of those mAbs demonstrate therapeutic efficacy to curtail viral burden and lung inflammation in animal models. The neutralization mechanisms of mAbs against SARS-CoV-2 in vivo are not fully understood, but optimal protection correlates with Fc effector functions. Approximately 30 SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing m Abs are undergoing clinical trials in COVID-19 patients. Some were granted emergency authorization since they reduced viral load, disease severity, and hospitalization in randomized, controlled phase II clinical trials. However, mAbs are unaffordable for healthcare systems in many developing countries due to their high cost (> USD 1,500/vial), meaning that most infected people would not have access to them. Another obstacle for COVID-19 therapy with mAbs is the emergence of viral variants harboring changes in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S1 glycoprotein. The variants of concern (VoC) exhibit enhanced transmissibility or virulence, circulate worldwide, and include those designated as alpha, beta, epsilon, gamma, and delta, first detected in the UK, South Africa, Brazil, USA, and India, respectively. Therapeutic mAbs, and antibodies in the plasma of vaccinated or convalescent individuals, fail to neutralize VoC efficiently.","Over 80 monoclonal antibody medicines have been shown to block the interaction between the coronavirus glycoprotein (a molecule that has a carbohydrate and a protein) and its cell receptor that can send signals, resulting in making the virus ineffective. The coronavirus causes COVID-1, a viral breathing-related disorder, and monoclonal antibodies are medicines that may block the virus that causes COVID-19 from attaching to human cells. Some of those monoclonal antibodies show that they work well to reduce the effects of the virus and lung inflammation (redness and swelling in response to infection) in animal studies. The process used by monoclonal antibodies to make the virus ineffective in humans and animals is not fully understood, but the best protection is associated with the Fc effector functions, which are the part of the antibody that interacts with other cells. Approximately 30 monoclonal antibodies are currently being tested in clinical trials in COVID-19 patients. Some are granted emergency authorization (where unapproved medicines may be used) because they reduce the amount of virus in the body, lessen the seriousness of the disease, and reduce hospital stays in clinical trials. However, monoclonal antibodies are expensive for healthcare systems in many developing countries, meaning that most infected people would not have access to the medicine. Another challenge for COVID-19 medicines that use monoclonal antibodies is the new variants that change cell receptor activity for the glycoprotein. The variants of concern are more easily transmitted between people, are found worldwide, and include those designated as alpha, beta, epsilon, gamma, and delta. Monoclonal antibody medicines, and antibodies in plasma (the liquid portion of blood) of vaccinated or recovering people, fail to efficiently make the variants of interest ineffective.",1,B

Here we report the development and evaluation of Fc-optimized anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs with superior potency to prevent or treat COVID-19 disease. In several animal models of COVID-19 disease we demonstrate that selective engagement of activating FcγRs results in improved efficacy in both preventing and treating disease-induced weight loss and mortality, significantly reducing the dose required to confer full protection upon SARS-CoV-2 challenge and treatment of pre-infected animals. Our results highlight the importance of FcγR pathways in driving antibody-mediated antiviral immunity, while excluding any pathogenic or disease-enhancing effects of FcγR engagement of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies upon infection. These findings have important implications for the development of Fc-engineered mAbs with optimal Fc effector function and improved clinical efficacy against COVID-19 disease.","Monoclonal antibodies are medicines that can make the coronavirus ineffective and have shown to be beneficial in cases of mild to moderate coronavirus infection, substantially reducing the risk for staying in the hospital and having severe symptoms of the disease.

In several animal studies of COVID-19, researchers show that activating certain parts of the Fc proteins results in improvements in both preventing and treating weight loss and death from the disease. This helps reduce the dose required to gain full protection in animals who are not infected with the coronavirus.

These results demonstrated that these antibodies recognize four distinct groups (I-IV) of epitopes on the RBD and that mAbs targeting group I epitope can be used in combination with mAbs recognizing groups II and/or IV epitope to make mAb cocktails against SARS-CoV-2 and its mutants. Moreover, structural characterization reveals that groups I, III, and IV epitopes are closely located to an RBD hotspot.

25,33080005,"Importance: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is threatening billions of people worldwide. Tocilizumab has shown promising results in retrospective studies in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia with a good safety profile. Objective: To evaluate the effect of early tocilizumab administration vs standard therapy in preventing clinical worsening in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia. Design, setting, and participants: Prospective, open-label, randomized clinical trial that randomized patients hospitalized between March 31 and June 11, 2020, with COVID-19 pneumonia to receive tocilizumab or standard of care in 24 hospitals in Italy. Cases of COVID-19 were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction method with nasopharyngeal swab. Eligibility criteria included COVID-19 pneumonia documented by radiologic imaging, partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen (Pao2/Fio2) ratio between 200 and 300 mm Hg, and an inflammatory phenotype defined by fever and elevated C-reactive protein. Interventions: Patients in the experimental arm received intravenous tocilizumab within 8 hours from randomization (8 mg/kg up to a maximum of 800 mg), followed by a second dose after 12 hours. Patients in the control arm received supportive care following the protocols of each clinical center until clinical worsening and then could receive tocilizumab as a rescue therapy. Main outcome and measures: The primary composite outcome was defined as entry into the intensive care unit with invasive mechanical ventilation, death from all causes, or clinical aggravation documented by the finding of a Pao2/Fio2 ratio less than 150 mm Hg, whichever came first. Results: A total of 126 patients were randomized (60 to the tocilizumab group; 66 to the control group). The median (interquartile range) age was 60.0 (53.0-72.0) years, and the majority of patients were male (77 of 126, 61.1%). Three patients withdrew from the study, leaving 123 patients available for the intention-to-treat analyses. Seventeen patients of 60 (28.3%) in the tocilizumab arm and 17 of 63 (27.0%) in the standard care group showed clinical worsening within 14 days since randomization (rate ratio, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.59-1.86). Two patients in the experimental group and 1 in the control group died before 30 days from randomization, and 6 and 5 patients were intubated in the 2 groups, respectively. The trial was prematurely interrupted after an interim analysis for futility. Conclusions and relevance: In this randomized clinical trial of hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and Pao2/Fio2 ratio between 200 and 300 mm Hg who received tocilizumab, no benefit on disease progression was observed compared with standard care. Further blinded, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials are needed to confirm the results and to evaluate possible applications of tocilizumab in different stages of the disease.","The COVID-19 pandemic is threatening billions of people worldwide.

The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of giving tocilizumab early, compared to the standard treatment, to prevent a hospitalized COVID-19 patient with pneumonia from getting worse. Patients who are in the hospital with COVID-19 pneumonia are randomly put in groups to receive either tocilizumab or the standard care. Cases of COVID-19 are confirmed by taking a swab from inside the back of the nose. To be included in the study, patients must have COVID-19 pneumonia confirmed by an x-ray, certain oxygen levels, a fever, and an increase in C-reactive proteins which are created in the liver in response to inflammation (redness and swelling from fighting an infection). Patients in the experimental group receive tocilizumab through an IV (medicine is delivered in a vein in the arm) within 8 hours of being randomly placed in the group. A second dose is given after 12 hours. Patients in the comparison group receive support care based on hospital standards until the patient's condition worsens, and then they receive tocilizumab. The main study observations of interest are 1) going into intensive care units with machines to help breathe, 2) death from all causes, or 3) a worsening of a condition measured by oxygen levels. A total of 126 patients are randomly put into the experimental group to receive tocilizumab (60 patients) or in the comparison group (66 patients). The average age is 60 years, and most patients (61.1%) are male. Three patients dropped out of the study, leaving 123 patients in the study. Within 14 days since they were randomly put into groups, 17 out of 60 patients in the tocilizumab (experimental) group and 17 out of 63 patients in the standard (comparison) group have worsening conditions. Two patients in the experimental group and 1 in the comparison group died before 30 days after being randomly assigned into groups. Six patients in the experimental group and 5 patients of the other group were intubated (a tube is inserted through the nose or throat to help a person breathe). The trial was stopped early after an analysis showed that the experimental group is not likely to show any added benefit than the comparison group. This clinical study of adult patients with COVID-19 pneumonia showed no benefit on lessening of the disease in patients receiving tocilizumab when compared to the standard care. Additional clinical studies are needed to confirm these results and to evaluate tocilizumab when given at different stages of the disease.",1,B
25,34521513,"Background: Monoclonal antibody therapy (MAT) is recommended in mild to moderate Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients who are at risk of progressing to severe disease. Due to limited data on its outcomes and the logistic challenges in administering the drug, MAT has not been widely used in the United States (US) despite of emergency use authorization (EUA) approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Aim: We aim to study the outcomes of MAT in patients predominantly from ethnic minority groups and the challenges we experienced in implementing the infusion therapy protocol in an inner-city safety-net-hospital in the South Bronx. Methods and results: We conducted a retrospective observational study of 49 patients who were offered MAT as per EUA protocol of FDA. Patient who met the criteria for MAT and received therapy were included in treatment group (n = 38) and the remaining (n = 11) who declined treatment were included in the control group. A majority of patients (76%) in the study group reported symptomatic improvement, the day after infusion. There was statistically significant reduction in COVID-19 related hospitalizations (7.8 vs 54.5%, P = < 0.001) mortality (0 vs 18.1%, P value = 0.008) in the treatment group. Conclusion: MAT reduced both hospitalization and mortality in this predominantly Hispanic patient population with mild to moderate COVID-19 with high risk factors for disease progression.","Monoclonal antibodies are medicines recommended in mild to moderate COVID-19 patients who are at risk of progressing to a severe stage of the disease. Monoclonal antibodies are medicines that may block the virus that causes COVID-19 (a breathing-related disease) from attaching to human cells, making it more difficult for the virus to reproduce. Monoclonal antibodies are not widely used in the United States because there is little data on the impact of these drugs, and it is difficult to give these drugs to patients. This study aimed to assess the outcomes of monoclonal antibodies in patients who were mostly from ethnic minority groups and to study the challenges in providing the treatment in an inner-city hospital in the South Bronx. Researchers looked at data previously collected from 49 patients who were offered monoclonal antibody medicines. The 38 patients who received the monoclonal antibody therapy were put in the treatment group. Eleven people did not want to receive the medicines, so they were made the comparison group. A majority of patients (76%) reported improvement in their symptoms the day after receiving the medicine. There was a big reduction in hospital stays due to COVID-19 and death in the group that received monoclonal antibody medicines. Monoclonal antibody medicines reduced both hospital stays and deaths in this predominantly Hispanic group of patients with mild or moderate COVID-19.",1,B
25,34409778,"Hyperinflammation and cytokine storm has been noted as a poor prognostic factor in patients with severe pneumonia related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In COVID-19, pathogenic myeloid cell overactivation is found to be a vital mediator of damage to tissues, hypercoagulability, and the cytokine storm. These cytokines unselectively infiltrate various tissues, such as the lungs and heart, and nervous system. This cytokine storm can hence cause multi-organ dysfunction and life-threatening complications. Mavrilimumab is a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that may be helpful in some cases with COVID-19. During an inflammation, Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) release is crucial to driving both innate and adaptive immune responses. The GM-CSF immune response is triggered when an antigen attaches to the host cell and induces the signaling pathway. Mavrilimumab antagonizes the action of GM-CSF and decreases the hyperinflammation associated with pneumonia in COVID-19, therefore strengthening the rationale that mavrilimumab when added to the standard protocol of treatment could improve the clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients, specifically those patients with pneumonia. With this review paper, we aim to demonstrate the inhibitory effect of mavrilimumab on cytokine storms in patients with COVID-19 by reviewing published clinical trials and emphasize the importance of extensive future trials.","Patients with severe pneumonia or lung infections related to COVID-19 (a viral breathing-related disease) may also have an overactive immune response and cytokine storm, which is when the immune system floods the body with proteins called cytokines. These events are associated with poor outcomes. In COVID-19, excessive activity of immune cells is linked to tissue damage, an increased risk of blood clots, and the cytokine storm. The cytokines enter different tissues, such as the lungs and heart, and the nervous system (the spinal cord, brain, and nerves). This cytokine storm can cause multiple organs to not work properly and cause life-threatening complications. Monoclonal antibodies are medicines that may block the virus that causes COVID-19 from attaching to human cells, making it more difficult for the virus to reproduce. One type of monoclonal antibody that may help some COVID-19 cases is mavrilimumab. During inflammation, the release of a GM-CSF, another type of protein that controls the body's immune responses, is necessary for proper immune responses. These proteins are triggered when a foreign substance attaches to a cell and creates a path for cells to communicate and pass information. Mavrilimumab disrupts the action of GM-CSF and decreases the severe inflammation associated with pneumonia in COVID-19. Therefore, adding mavrilimumab to the standard treatment may improve the condition of COVID-19 patients, especially those with pneumonia. This paper reviews data from published studies to show how mavrilimumab can block cytokine storms in patients with COVID-19, and to highlight the importance of future studies.",1,B

In COVID-19, disease-causing white blood cell overactivation is a key mediator of damage to tissues, increased blood clots, and inflammatory molecule overproduction. These inflammatory molecules invade many body parts like the lungs, heart, and nervous system. This overproduction of inflammatory molecules can cause multi-organ damage and life-threatening issues. Mavrilimumab is a monoclonal antibody (mAb), which binds to only one site of a foreign organism. It may aid some cases of COVID-19.

27,33301246,"Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and the resulting coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) have afflicted tens of millions of people in a worldwide pandemic. Safe and effective vaccines are needed urgently. Methods: In an ongoing multinational, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded, pivotal efficacy trial, we randomly assigned persons 16 years of age or older in a 1:1 ratio to receive two doses, 21 days apart, of either placebo or the BNT162b2 vaccine candidate (30 μg per dose). BNT162b2 is a lipid nanoparticle-formulated, nucleoside-modified RNA vaccine that encodes a prefusion stabilized, membrane-anchored SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike protein. The primary end points were efficacy of the vaccine against laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 and safety. Results: A total of 43,548 participants underwent randomization, of whom 43,448 received injections: 21,720 with BNT162b2 and 21,728 with placebo. There were 8 cases of Covid-19 with onset at least 7 days after the second dose among participants assigned to receive BNT162b2 and 162 cases among those assigned to placebo; BNT162b2 was 95% effective in preventing Covid-19 (95% credible interval, 90.3 to 97.6). Similar vaccine efficacy (generally 90 to 100%) was observed across subgroups defined by age, sex, race, ethnicity, baseline body-mass index, and the presence of coexisting conditions. Among 10 cases of severe Covid-19 with onset after the first dose, 9 occurred in placebo recipients and 1 in a BNT162b2 recipient. The safety profile of BNT162b2 was characterized by short-term, mild-to-moderate pain at the injection site, fatigue, and headache. The incidence of serious adverse events was low and was similar in the vaccine and placebo groups. Conclusions: A two-dose regimen of BNT162b2 conferred 95% protection against Covid-19 in persons 16 years of age or older. Safety over a median of 2 months was similar to that of other viral vaccines. (Funded by BioNTech and Pfizer; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04368728.).","The coronavirus and the resulting Covid-19 disease (a viral, breathing-related disease) has impacted tens of millions of people around the world. Vaccines that are safe and work well are urgently needed. In a clinical study that is in progress, people who are at least 16 years old are randomly placed in a group to receive two doses of either a placebo (a shot that does not have medicine) or the BNT162b2 vaccine. The BNT162b2 vaccine works by increasing proteins that help the immune system. The main study outcomes are how well the vaccine works against Covid-19 and its safety. A total of 43,548 participants are randomly put into two groups. Among this group, 43,448 received shots: 21,720 with the BNT162b2 vaccine and 21,728 with the placebo. Among people who received the BNT162b2 vaccine, 8 got Covid-19 at least 7 days after they received the second dose. Among people who received the placebo, 162 got Covid-19. The BNT162b2 vaccine was 95% effective in preventing Covid-19. Similar results are observed across smaller groups of participants when looking at age, sex, race, ethnicity, weight, and the presence of other conditions. Among 10 cases of serious Covid-19 starting after the first dose, 9 cases happened in people who received the placebo and 1 in someone who received the BNT162b2 vaccine. The safety of the BNT162b2 vaccine is described as having short-term, mild-to-moderate pain on the arm where the shot was given, tiredness, and a headache. The number of serious side effects is low and is similar in the vaccine and placebo groups. In conclusion, receiving two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine provided 95% protection against Covid-19 in people 16 years or older.

27,33629336,"Objective: The ""Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)"" disease has caused a worldwide challenging and threatening pandemic (COVID-19), with huge health and economic losses. The US Food and Drug Administration, (FDA) has granted emergency use authorization for treatment with the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines. Many people have a history of a significant allergic reaction to a specific food, medicine, or vaccine; hence, people all over the world have great concerns about these two authorized vaccines. This article compares the pharmacology, indications, contraindications, and adverse effects of the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. Materials and methods: The required documents and information were collected from the relevant databases, including Web of Science (Clarivate Analytics), PubMed, EMBASE, World Health Organization (WHO), Food and Drug Authorities (FDA) USA, Local Ministries, Health Institutes, and Google Scholar. The key terms used were: Coronavirus, SARS-COV-2, COVID-19 pandemic, vaccines, Pfizer/BioN Tech vaccine, Moderna vaccine, pharmacology, benefits, allergic responses, indications, contraindications, and adverse effects. The descriptive information was recorded, and we eventually included 12 documents including research articles, clinical trials, and websites to record the required information. Results: Based on the currently available literature, both vaccines are beneficial to provide immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Pfizer/BioN Tech Vaccine has been recommended to people 16 years of age and older, with a dose of 30 μg (0.3 m) at a cost of $19.50. It provides immunogenicity for at least 119 days after the first vaccination and is 95% effective in preventing the SARS-COV-2 infection. However, Moderna Vaccine has been recommended to people 18 years of age and older, with a dose of 50 μg (0.5 mL) at a cost of $32-37. It provides immunogenicity for at least 119 days after the first vaccination and is 94.5% effective in preventing the SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, some associated allergic symptoms have been reported for both vaccines. The COVID-19 vaccines can cause mild adverse effects after the first or second doses, including pain, redness or swelling at the site of vaccine shot, fever, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, nausea, vomiting, itching, chills, and joint pain, and can also rarely cause anaphylactic shock. The occurrence of adverse effects is reported to be lower in the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine compared to the Moderna vaccine; however, the Moderna vaccine compared to the Pfizer vaccine is easier to transport and store because it is less temperature sensitive. Conclusions: The FDA has granted emergency use authorization for the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines. These vaccines can protect recipients from a SARS-CoV- 2 infection by formation of antibodies and provide immunity against a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Both vaccines can cause various adverse effects, but these reactions are reported to be less frequent in the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine compared to the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine; however, the Moderna vaccine compared to the Pfizer vaccine is easier to transport and store because it is less temperature sensitive.","The coronavirus disease has caused a global pandemic (Covid-19 - a viral breathing-related disease), with huge health and economic losses. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted emergency use authorization, where unapproved medicines may be used, for treatment with the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna Covid-19 vaccines. Many people have a history of bad allergic reactions to specific foods, medicine, or vaccines, so people all over the world have great concerns about these two vaccines. This article compares the use, reasons to take, reasons to not get, and side effects of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. The documents and information are collected from multiple databases and sources, including the FDA and World Health Organization. Researchers used key search terms to collect information: Coronavirus, SARS-COV-2 (the coronavirus's name), Covid-19 pandemic, vaccines, Pfizer vaccine, Moderna vaccine, impact of drugs, benefits, allergic responses, reasons to take vaccines, reasons to not take the vaccine, and unexpected serious side effects. Twelve documents including research articles, clinical studies, and websites are used to record the required information.

27,34383735,"In December 2020, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) for Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines, and in February 2021, FDA issued an EUA for the Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) COVID-19 vaccine. After each EUA, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) issued interim recommendations for vaccine use; currently Pfizer-BioNTech is authorized and recommended for persons aged ≥12 years and Moderna and Janssen for persons aged ≥18 years (1-3). Both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, administered as 2-dose series, are mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines, whereas the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, administered as a single dose, is a recombinant replication-incompetent adenovirus-vector vaccine. As of July 22, 2021, 187 million persons in the United States had received at least 1 dose of COVID-19 vaccine (4); close monitoring of safety surveillance has demonstrated that serious adverse events after COVID-19 vaccination are rare (5,6). Three medical conditions have been reported in temporal association with receipt of COVID-19 vaccines. Two of these (thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome [TTS], a rare syndrome characterized by venous or arterial thrombosis and thrombocytopenia, and Guillain-Barré syndrome [GBS], a rare autoimmune neurologic disorder characterized by ascending weakness and paralysis) have been reported after Janssen COVID-19 vaccination. One (myocarditis, cardiac inflammation) has been reported after Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccination or Moderna COVID-19 vaccination, particularly after the second dose; these were reviewed together and will hereafter be referred to as mRNA COVID-19 vaccination. ACIP has met three times to review the data associated with these reports of serious adverse events and has comprehensively assessed the benefits and risks associated with receipt of these vaccines. During the most recent meeting in July 2021, ACIP determined that, overall, the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination in preventing COVID-19 morbidity and mortality outweigh the risks for these rare serious adverse events in adults aged ≥18 years; this balance of benefits and risks varied by age and sex. ACIP continues to recommend COVID-19 vaccination in all persons aged ≥12 years. CDC and FDA continue to closely monitor reports of serious adverse events and will present any additional data to ACIP for consideration. Information regarding risks and how they vary by age and sex and type of vaccine should be disseminated to providers, vaccine recipients, and the public.","In December 2020, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued Emergency Use Authorizations (when unapproved medicines may be used) for Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna Covid-19 vaccines (vaccines for the viral, respiratory disease).

After each emergency authorization was issued, short-term recommendations for vaccine use were issued. Currently, Pfizer is authorized and recommended for persons aged 12 years or older and Moderna and Janssen for persons aged 18 years and older. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines require two shots and use a strand of genetic code that the body uses to build a protein that’s found in the coronavirus. The Janssen vaccine requires one shot and delivers instructions by DNA that the virus cannot replicate. As of July 22, 2021, 187 million people in the United States received at least one shot of the Covid-19 vaccine, and it has been demonstrated that serious side effects are rare. Three medical conditions have been reported after getting the Covid-19 vaccine, but the association between these conditions and the vaccine is mainly based on timing, in which the condition and vaccine occur around the same time. Two of these conditions are reported after getting the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. They are 1) thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome [TTS], a rare condition with blood clots in the veins and arteries and low blood platelet counts (platelets help the body form blood clots to stop bleeding from injury), and 2) Guillain-Barré syndrome [GBS], a rare disorder characterized by muscle weakness and paralysis.

Objective: To describe the clinical characteristics and outcome of patients with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination with and without TTS. Design, setting, and participants: This cohort study used data from an international registry of consecutive patients with CVST within 28 days of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination included between March 29 and June 18, 2021, from 81 hospitals in 19 countries. For reference, data from patients with CVST between 2015 and 2018 were derived from an existing international registry. Clinical characteristics and mortality rate were described for adults with (1) CVST in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia, (2) CVST after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination not fulling criteria for TTS, and (3) CVST unrelated to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Exposures: Patients were classified as having TTS if they had new-onset thrombocytopenia without recent exposure to heparin, in accordance with the Brighton Collaboration interim criteria. Main outcomes and measures: Clinical characteristics and mortality rate. Results: Of 116 patients with postvaccination CVST, 78 (67.2%) had TTS, of whom 76 had been vaccinated with ChAdOx1 nCov-19; 38 (32.8%) had no indication of TTS. The control group included 207 patients with CVST before the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 63 of 78 (81%), 30 of 38 (79%), and 145 of 207 (70.0%) patients, respectively, were female, and the mean (SD) age was 45 (14), 55 (20), and 42 (16) years, respectively. Concomitant thromboembolism occurred in 25 of 70 patients (36%) in the TTS group, 2 of 35 (6%) in the no TTS group, and 10 of 206 (4.9%) in the control group, and in-hospital mortality rates were 47% (36 of 76; 95% CI, 37-58), 5% (2 of 37; 95% CI, 1-18), and 3.9% (8 of 207; 95% CI, 2.0-7.4), respectively. The mortality rate was 61% (14 of 23) among patients in the TTS group diagnosed before the condition garnered attention in the scientific community and 42% (22 of 53) among patients diagnosed later. Conclusions and relevance: In this cohort study of patients with CVST, a distinct clinical profile and high mortality rate was observed in patients meeting criteria for TTS after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.","Thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) is a rare condition of blood clots in the veins and arteries and low blood platelet counts. TTS has been reported in some people after they receive the AstraZeneca and Janssen/Johnson & Johnson vaccines. These vaccines provide immunity or resistance to the coronavirus, which causes COVID-19 (a viral, respiratory disease). The objective of this study is to describe the clinical traits and outcomes of patients with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) (blood clot in the brain) after receiving the coronavirus vaccine among people with and without TTS. This study uses data from patients who have CVST within 28 days of vaccination in March-June 2021. Data came from 81 hospitals in 19 countries. Existing data from patients with CVST between 2015 and 2018 are used to compare. Clinical traits and death are described for adults with (1) CVST in the case of coronavirus vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia, (2) CVST after coronavirus vaccination not meeting all parts for TTS, and (3) CVST unrelated to the coronavirus vaccination. Patients are classified as having TTS (thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome) if they have new thrombocytopenia (low blood platelets) without recent exposure to heparin, a medicine that prevents blood clots. Clinical traits and deaths are the main measures in this study. Of the 116 patients with CVST after being vaccinated, 78 (67.2%) have TTS. Of those, 76 people had been vaccinated with AstraZeneca and 38 (32.8%) have no indication of TTS. The comparison group included 207 patients with CVST before the Covid-19 pandemic.

27,34559576,"Purpose: The COVID-19 pandemic has galvanized the development of new vaccines at an unprecedented pace. Since the widespread implementation of vaccination campaigns, reports of ocular adverse effects after COVID-19 vaccinations have emerged. This review summarizes ocular adverse effects possibly associated with COVID-19 vaccination, and discusses their clinical characteristics and management. Results: Ocular adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations include facial nerve palsy, abducens nerve palsy, acute macular neuroretinopathy, central serous retinopathy, thrombosis, uveitis, multiple evanescent white dot syndrome, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease reactivation, and new-onset Graves' Disease. Studies in current literature are primarily retrospective case series or isolated case reports - these are inherently weak in establishing association or causality. Nevertheless, the described presentations resemble the reported ocular manifestations of the COVID-19 disease itself. Hence, we hypothesize that the human body's immune response to COVID-19 vaccinations may be involved in the pathogenesis of the ocular adverse effects post-COVID-19 vaccination. Conclusion: Ophthalmologists and generalists should be aware of the possible, albeit rare, ocular adverse effects after COVID-19 vaccination.","The pandemic of Covid-19 (a viral, breathing-related disease) has led to the development of new vaccines at an very fast pace. Since the start of major efforts to promote vaccination, reports of ocular adverse effects, which are side effects that impact the eyes or the face near the eyes, after Covid-19 vaccinations have emerged. This review summarizes these ocular adverse effects that are possibly associated with Covid-19 vaccines and discusses their medical traits and how to care for these effects. Ocular adverse effects of Covid-19 vaccinations include weakness or paralysis in the facial muscles, problems with eye movement, blind or blurry spots, distorted vision due to fluid build up in the eye, blood clots in the veins or arteries, inflammation (redness or swelling from fighting an infection) inside the eye, inflammation in the retina of the eye, rapid vision loss from previous diseases, and newly-contracted Graves' Disease, a condition that increases thyroid (metabolism-regulating) hormones and can impact the skin and eyes. Published studies mainly use existing information from previous cases or isolated reports; these are weak studies in establishing association or cause and effect. However, the described cases are similar, regarding the impact on the eyes or vision, to the Covid-19 disease itself. Researchers have a theory that the body's immune response to Covid-19 vaccinations may be involved in the development of the ocular adverse effects that occur after receiving the Covid-19 vaccine. Eye surgeons and doctors should be aware of the possible, although rare, ocular adverse effects that impact the eyes after a Covid-19 vaccine.",1,C
28,34571039,"The global pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its threat to humans have drawn worldwide attention. The acute and long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the nervous system pose major public health challenges. Patients with SARS-CoV-2 present diverse symptoms of the central nervous system. Exploring the mechanism of coronavirus damage to the nervous system is essential for reducing the long-term neurological complications of COVID-19. Despite rapid progress in characterizing SARS-CoV-2, the long-term effects of COVID-19 on the brain remain unclear. The possible mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 injury to the central nervous system include: 1) direct injury of nerve cells, 2) activation of the immune system and inflammatory cytokines caused by systemic infection, 3) a high affinity of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein for the angiotensin-converting enzyme ACE2, 4) cerebrovascular disease caused by hypoxia and coagulation dysfunction, and 5) a systemic inflammatory response that promotes cognitive impairment and neurodegenerative diseases. Although we do not fully understand the mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 causes nerve injury, we hope to provide a framework by reviewing the clinical manifestations, complications, and possible mechanisms of neurological damage caused by SARS-CoV-2.

Patients with COVID-19 present a wide range of symptoms of the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord). It is essential to better understand how COVID-19 affects the nervous system. Increasing current understanding will reduce the long-term effects COVID-19 may cause within the brain. Despite rapid progress in better understanding how COVID-19 hurts the human body, the long-term effects of the virus on the brain are still unclear. There are several possible ways COVID-19 affects the central nervous system. One of these ways is by potentially hurting nerve cells. Second, the virus may cause body-wide inflammation (redness and swelling from fighting an infection) that may activate the immune system. Third, COVID-19 may be highly attracted to a specific pathway into cells and can then rapidly distribute throughout the body. Fourth, the virus may cause disease by decreasing oxygen and increase blood clotting within the body. And lastly, COVID-19 may cause body-wide inflammation that decreases brain function. Despite not fully understanding how COVID-19 causes nerve injury, the authors hoped to provide a review of clinical reports, documented human health effects, and potential pathways of COVID-19-caused brain damage. The aim of this paper was to assist in early detection, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID-19-caused brain damage. Additionally, the authors hope this can help predict COVID-19 related effects before they occur and decrease viral spread in general.",1,B

The acute and long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the nervous system pose major public health challenges. Patients with SARS-CoV-2 present diverse symptoms of the central nervous system. Exploring the mechanism of coronavirus damage to the nervous system is essential for reducing the long-term neurological complications of COVID-19. Despite rapid progress in characterizing SARS-CoV-2, the long-term effects of COVID-19 on the brain remain unclear. The possible mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 injury to the central nervous system include: 1) direct injury of nerve cells, 2) activation of the immune system and inflammatory cytokines caused by systemic infection, 3) a high affinity of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein for the angiotensin-converting enzyme ACE2, 4) cerebrovascular disease caused by hypoxia and coagulation dysfunction, and 5) a systemic inflammatory response that promotes cognitive impairment and neurodegenerative diseases. Although we do not fully understand the mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 causes nerve injury, we hope to provide a framework by reviewing the clinical manifestations, complications, and possible mechanisms of neurological damage caused by SARS-CoV-2. With hope, this will facilitate the early identification, diagnosis, and treatment of possible neurological sequelae, which could contribute toward improving patient prognosis and preventing transmission.","The global pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a breathing-related viral illness, and its threat to humans have drawn worldwide attention.

Exploring how coronavirus damages the nervous system is essential to reduce the long-term damage from COVID-19, or SARS-CoV-2 illness, to the nervous system. Despite rapid progress in describing SARS-CoV-2, the long-term effects of COVID-19 on the brain is unclear.

28,34549987,"Emerging evidence suggests that endothelial activation plays a central role in the pathogenesis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ failure in patients with COVID-19. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying endothelial activation in COVID-19 patients remain unclear. In this study, the SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins that potently activate human endothelial cells were screened to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in endothelial activation. It was found that nucleocapsid protein (NP) of SARS-CoV-2 significantly activated human endothelial cells through TLR2/NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways. Moreover, by screening a natural microbial compound library containing 154 natural compounds, simvastatin was identified as a potent inhibitor of NP-induced endothelial activation. Remarkablely, though the protein sequences of N proteins from coronaviruses are highly conserved, only NP from SARS-CoV-2 induced endothelial activation. The NPs from other coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HUB1-CoV and influenza virus H1N1 did not activate endothelial cells. These findings are well consistent with the results from clinical investigations showing broad endotheliitis and organ injury in severe COVID-19 patients. In conclusion, the study provides insights on SARS-CoV-2-induced vasculopathy and coagulopathy, and suggests that simvastatin, an FDA-approved lipid-lowering drug, may benefit to prevent the pathogenesis and improve the outcome of COVID-19 patients. IMPORTANCE Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2, is a worldwide challenge for health-care systems. The leading cause of mortality in patients with COVID-19 is hypoxic respiratory failure from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). To date, pulmonary endothelial cells (ECs) have been largely overlooked as a therapeutic target in COVID-19, yet emerging evidence suggests that these cells contribute to the initiation and propagation of ARDS by altering vessel barrier integrity, promoting a pro-coagulative state, inducing vascular inflammation and mediating inflammatory cell infiltration. Therefore, a better mechanistic understanding of the vasculature is of utmost importance. In this study, we screened the SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins that potently activate human endothelial cells and found that nucleocapsid protein (NP) significantly activated human endothelial cells through TLR2/NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways. Moreover, by screening a natural microbial compound library containing 154 natural compounds, simvastatin was identified as a potent inhibitor of NP-induced endothelial activation. Our results provide insights on SARS-CoV-2-induced vasculopathy and coagulopathy, and suggests that simvastatin, an FDA-approved lipid-lowering drug, may benefit to prevent the pathogenesis and improve the outcome of COVID-19 patients.","Recent scientific reports suggest that increased endothelial activation plays a key role in the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ failure seen within patients of COVID-19 (a viral, breathing-related disease). Endothelial cells line our organs within our body, especially blood vessels. When these cells become activated, they encourage inflammation (redness and swelling from fighting an infection) and blood clotting or scabbing. However, how COVID-19 causes this endothelial cell activation is unclear. In this study, COVID-19 virus proteins (small molecules within the virus that help it function) were analyzed. The goal of analyzing the proteins was to determine how they might activate endothelial cells. This study found a specific protein of COVID-19 that highly activated endothelial cells through two specific bodily pathways. Secondly, the authors identified a prescription medication, known as Simvastatin, that can reduce the identified endothelial activation. The authors also noted that the identified protein only caused endothelial activation in COVID-19 illness. This protein in other illnesses, such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HUB1-CoV and influenza virus H1N1, did not activate endothelial cells. These scientific findings match with results from clinical research (research within patients). Clinical research has shown broad endothelial cell inflammation and organ injury within COVID-19 patients. The authors concluded this paper increases current knowledge surrounding how COVID-19 impacts blood vessels and blood flow within patients. Additionally, this paper suggested simvastatin may help prevent damage and improve overall health within COVID-19 patients. COVID-19, caused by a coronavirus, is a worldwide challenge for health-care. The leading cause of death in those with COVID-19 is lack of oxygen in the blood from a breathing-related illness. To date, cells that line the lungs and its blood vessels have been overlooked as a therapy target in COVID-19, yet new evidence suggests these cells contribute to the start and spread of breathing-related illnesses by changing blood vessel structures, promoting clotting, causing inflammation, and influencing inflammatory cell reactions. Therefore, a better understanding of the blood vessels Is of great importance. In this study, we tested COVID-19 virus proteins that activate these blood-vessel lining cells and found that viral proteins activate these cells through phosphate-related pathways. Also, by testing a natural microorganism library with 154 natural compounds, simvastatin was found to be a powerful blocker of the viral-caused lining cell activation. Our results give insights on the viral-caused blood- and blood vessel-related diseases, and suggests that simvastatin, an FDA-approved fat-lowering drug, may help prevent these diseases and improve outcomes for COVID-19 patients.",1,B
28,34517257,"Background: Inflammation-mediated lung injury is a major cause of health problems in many countries and has been the leading cause of morbidity/mortality in intensive care units. In the current COVID-19 pandemic, the majority of the patients experienced serious pneumonia resulting from inflammation (Acute respiratory distress syndrome/ARDS). Pathogenic infections cause cytokine release syndrome (CRS) by hyperactivation of immune cells, which in turn release excessive cytokines causing ARDS. Currently, there are no standard therapies for viral, bacterial or pathogen-mediated CRS. Purpose: This study aimed to investigate and validate the protective effects of Dehydrozingerone (DHZ) against LPS induced lung cell injury by in-vitro and in-vivo models and to gain insights into the molecular mechanisms that mediate these therapeutic effects. Methods: The therapeutic activity of DHZ was determined in in-vitro models by pre-treating the cells with DHZ and exposed to LPS to stimulate the inflammatory cascade of events. We analysed the effect of DHZ on LPS induced inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and cell damage markers expression/levels using various cell lines. We performed gene expression, ELISA, and western blot analysis to elucidate the effect of DHZ on inflammation and its modulation of MAPK and NF-κB pathways. Further, the prophylactic and therapeutic effect of DHZ was evaluated against the LPS induced ARDS model in rats. Results: DHZ significantly (p < 0.01) attenuated the LPS induced ROS, inflammatory cytokine, chemokine gene expression and protein release in macrophages. Similarly, DHZ treatment protected the lung epithelial and endothelial cells by mitigating the LPS induced inflammatory events in a dose-dependent manner. In vivo analysis showed that DHZ treatment significantly (p < 0.001) mitigated the LPS induced ARDS pathophysiology of increase in the inflammatory cells in BALF, inflammatory cytokine and chemokines in lung tissues. LPS stimulated neutrophil-mediated events, apoptosis, alveolar wall thickening and alveolar inflammation were profoundly reduced by DHZ treatment in a rat model. Conclusion: This study demonstrates for the first time that DHZ has the potential to ameliorate LPS induced ARDS by inhibiting cytokine storm and oxidative through modulating the MAPK and NF-κB pathways. This data provides pre-clinical support to develop DHZ as a potential therapeutic agent against ARDS.","Lung injuries caused by inflammation (redness and swelling from fighting an infection) in the body is a major cause of health problems in several countries. Additionally, inflammation is a leading cause for disease and death within intensive care units (ICU) in hospitals. The majority of patients of COVID-19 (a viral, breathing-related or respiratory disease) have suffered from a condition known as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that results from inflammation. It is similar to pneumonia (lung infection). Infections within the body can trigger the excess release of cytokines. Cytokines are proteins that can tell your immune system what to do. Sometimes, when we are sick, cytokines stimulate too many immune cells, causing hyperactivation, which in turn causes more cytokines to release more signals. This causes a biological loop known as cytokine release syndrome (CRS) that results in ARDS. Currently, there are no medical treatments to prevent CRS that is causes by viruses, bacteria, or germs. The goal of this paper was to better understand how a chemical, known as Dehydrozingerone (DHZ), can protect lung cells from damage caused by lipopolysaccharides (LPS). LPS are molecules that exist within the cell walls of bacteria and are extremely toxic. This study used two types of studies, in vitro (in cells) and in vivo (in animals), to fully comprehend how DHZ can prevent LPS-induced lung cell injury. For the in vitro study, cells were treated with DHZ before being exposed to LPS. This caused a series of inflammatory events to occur within the treated cells. The authors reviewed how DHZ protected against LPS damage within several different types of cells. They performed several lab tests looking at cells' internal health to better determine the effect DHZ had on inflammation and how it was protective. Additionally, the authors determined how DHZ could prevent disease and protect against LPS within rats already sick with ARDS. Within one type of cell, DHZ significantly decreased the negative effects caused by LPS exposure. Similarly, DHZ protected lung cells by reducing LPS-induced inflammation in a dose-dependent manner. Meaning as the amount of DHZ given was increased, the symptoms from LPS treatment decreased. In the rats treated with DHZ, the chemical significantly reduced LPS-caused ARDS. DHZ significantly reduced several harmful effects of LPS within the rat model, including cell injury and cell death. This study is the first to show that DHZ has the ability to protect against ARDS by decreasing harmful immune responses triggered by LPS. This data provides support to develop DHZ as a potential human pharmaceutical prescription or drug to protect against ARDS.",1,B

This review focuses on the effects of SARS-CoV-2 in the heart after direct infection that can lead to myocarditis and an outline of potential treatment options. The main points are: (1) Viral entry: SARS-CoV-2 uses specific receptors and proteases for docking and priming in cardiac cells.

This paper reviews the effects COVID-19 has on the heart after direct infection, which can lead to myocarditis. Myocarditis is inflammation of the heart muscle. This paper will also outline potential treatment options for this illness. The authors proposed seven potential treatment options to help reduce heart injury in COVID-19 patients. First, the virus uses specific entry points to infect heart cells so that it can replicate and grow stronger. Therefore, specific drugs that target these entry points might be helpful. Second, COVID-19 uses a specific pathway to replicate itself. This pathway uses RNA, a chain of genetic material that helps form proteins. Drugs that prevent the creation of RNA for viral replication could be helpful. Third, COVID-19 decreases the body's ability to degrade infected cells. This prevents the body from decreasing the amount of virus within it. COVID-19 is able to replicate as it creates double-membrane vesicles, extra-strong chambers, as spaces safe from the body's natural defense system. Fourth, COVID-19 can cause the host immune response to be changed so that the virus is not targeted for removal. It can also increase inflammation (redness and swelling from fighting an infection) which alters the function of immune cells. Better understanding of drugs that suppress the immune system is needed. Fifth, COVID-19 prevents cells from dying in the early stages of infection but induces cell death later, once it has replicated and moved to other cells. Sixth, COVID-19 infection can disturb energy metabolism (the process in getting energy from food). This can reduce energy production and affect cell function and viability. Seventh, COVID-19 creates virus proteins to lead to an imbalance within the host body. This can cause cell death, abnormal heart function, and an abnormal heartbeat.",1,B

We identified 160 cellular proteins as interaction partners of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein in HEK293T and/or Calu-3 cells. Functional analysis revealed strong enrichment for ribosome biogenesis and RNA-associated processes, including ribonucleoprotein complex biogenesis, ribosomal large and small subunits biogenesis, RNA binding, catalysis, translation and transcription.

In order to better understand how the virus protein works, proteins within human cells that interact with the COVID-19 protein were identified. The authors identified 160 proteins within two different human cell types that interact in some way with the COVID-19 protein. The human proteins found to interact with the virus protein are responsible for several cell functions, all of which impact the creation of more proteins. Additionally, some human proteins identified to interact with the virus protein have roles in defending the body from viruses.

28,34577851,"Background and Objectives. The importance of mitochondria in inflammatory pathologies, besides providing energy, is associated with the release of mitochondrial damage products, such as mitochondrial DNA (mt-DNA), which may perpetuate inflammation. In this review, we aimed to show the importance of mitochondria, as organelles that produce energy and intervene in multiple pathologies, focusing mainly in COVID-19 and using multiple molecular mechanisms that allow for the replication and maintenance of the viral genome, leading to the exacerbation and spread of the inflammatory response. The evidence suggests that mitochondria are implicated in the replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which forms double-membrane vesicles and evades detection by the cell defense system. These mitochondrion-hijacking vesicles damage the integrity of the mitochondrion's membrane, releasing mt-DNA into circulation and triggering the activation of innate immunity, which may contribute to an exacerbation of the pro-inflammatory state. Conclusions. While mitochondrial dysfunction in COVID-19 continues to be studied, the use of mt-DNA as an indicator of prognosis and severity is a potential area yet to be explored.","Mitochondria (the powerhouse of a cell) play several important roles in the body. These roles include providing energy and participating in pathways of inflammation (redness and swelling from fighting an infection). The event of mitochondria increasing inflammation is associated with the release of products from mitochondrial damage. One of these products is mitochondrial DNA which can increase inflammation within the body. This review aimed to show the importance of the mitochondria in energy production and in the intervention in the development of several diseases, mainly COVID-19 (a viral, respiratory disease). Additionally the paper aimed to show how the mitochondria organelle uses several different ways to allow the replication and maintenance of a virus. This can lead to the worsening and spread of inflammation. The reviewed scientific evidence suggested that mitochondria are involved in the replication of COVID-19. The virus forms double-walled vesicles, a small chamber outside or within a cell, that evades detection by the host's immune system. These vesicles can then damage mitochondria within cells, releasing mitochondrial DNA into the body. This can trigger the innate immune system, the defense system you were born with, which increase inflammation within the body. This review concluded that while the role of the mitochondria in COVID-19 is still being studied, the use of mitochondrial DNA as an indicator of illness is a potential area yet to be researched.",1,B
28,34562551,"Some COVID-19 patients suffer complications from anti-viral immune responses which can lead to both a dangerous cytokine storm and development of blood-borne factors that render severe thrombotic events more likely. The precise immune response profile is likely, therefore, to determine and predict patient outcomes and also represents a target for intervention. Anti-viral T cell exhaustion in the early stages is associated with disease progression. Dysregulation of T cell functions, which precedes cytokine storm development and neutrophil expansion in alveolar tissues heralds damaging pathology. T cell function, cytokine production and factors that attract neutrophils to the lung can be modified through targeting molecules that can modulate T cell responses. Manipulating T cell responses by targeting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway could provide the means to control the immune response in COVID-19 patients. During the initial anti-viral response, T cell effector function can be enhanced by delaying anti-viral exhaustion through inhibiting PI3K and Akt. Additionally, immune dysregulation can be addressed by enhancing immune suppressor functions by targeting downstream mTOR, an important intracellular modulator of cellular metabolism. Targeting this signalling pathway also has potential to prevent formation of thrombi due to its role in platelet activation. Furthermore, this signalling pathway is essential for SARS-cov-2 virus replication in host cells and its inhibition could, therefore, reduce viral load. The ultimate goal is to identify targets that can quickly control the immune response in COVID-19 patients to improve patient outcome. Targeting different levels of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signalling pathway could potentially achieve this during each stage of the disease.","Some patients suffer complications from anti-viral immune responses, or the response their body creates when infected with a virus. These complications can lead to both a dangerous cytokine storm (proteins that control activity of immune and blood cells that flood the body) and development of blood-borne factors that increase the likelihood of blood clots or scabs. Each person's unique immune response will likely determine and predict how a patient will react to infection. Therefore, each person's immune system represents a target for intervention to prevent harmful side effects. In the early stages of infection, exhausted or overworked T cells (an immune system cell) can lead to disease progression. Alteration of T cell functions often comes before a cytokine storm and neutrophil expansion, or the suppression of immune system. When these events occur in lung tissues, diseases are often even more damaging. T cell function, cytokine production, and events that attract neutrophils (cells that sweep humans for signs of infection) to the lung can be changed by specifically targeting molecules that trigger T cell responses. Manipulating T cell responses could provide the means to control the immune response in patients with COVID-19 (a viral, breathing-related disorder). During the initial anti-viral response, T cell function can be enhanced by delaying anti-viral exhaustion by suppressing certain biological pathways. Additionally, immune dysregulation or errors can be addressed by enhancing immune suppressor functions by targeting molecules that control cell metabolism. Targeting cell metabolism pathways may also prevent formation of blood clots. Furthermore, the cell metabolism pathway is needed for COVID-19 replication in host cells. Suppressing the pathway could potentially decrease the amount of virus within the host. The overall goal is to identify biological targets than can control the immune response in COVID-19 patients to improve patient well-being. Targeting specific pathways in the body could achieve this goal during each stage of the disease.",1,B

These can lead to a dangerous inflammatory molecule overproduction and blood-borne substances that increase blood clotting risk. The exact immune response type may determine and predict patient outcomes. It may also be a target for treatment. Elimination of specific anti-viral immune cells called T cells in the early stages is linked with disease progression. Damaged T cell function, which is before inflammatory molecule overproduction and expansion in lungs, signals harmful disease effects. T cell function, inflammatory molecule production and attraction to the lung can be changed by targeting molecules that can alter responses of specific immune cells. Changing T cell responses by targeting a specific pathway may help control the immune response in COVID-19 patients.

28,34531331,"Senescent cells, which arise due to damage-associated signals, are apoptosis-resistant and can express a pro-inflammatory, tissue-destructive senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). We recently reported that a component of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) surface protein, S1, can amplify the SASP of senescent cultured human cells and that a related mouse β-coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), increases SASP factors and senescent cell burden in infected mice. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 induces senescence in human non-senescent cells and exacerbates the SASP in human senescent cells through Toll-like receptor-3 (TLR-3). TLR-3, which senses viral RNA, was increased in human senescent compared to non-senescent cells. Notably, genetically or pharmacologically inhibiting TLR-3 prevented senescence induction and SASP amplification by SARS-CoV-2 or Spike pseudotyped virus. While an artificial TLR-3 agonist alone was not sufficient to induce senescence, it amplified the SASP in senescent human cells. Consistent with these findings, lung p16INK4a+ senescent cell burden was higher in patients who died from acute SARS-CoV-2 infection than other causes. Our results suggest that induction of cellular senescence and SASP amplification through TLR-3 contribute to SARS-CoV-2 morbidity, indicating that clinical trials of senolytics and/or SASP/TLR-3 inhibitors for alleviating acute and long-term SARS-CoV-2 sequelae are warranted.","Senescent cells are cells that are no longer able to divide but are still active. Senescent cells become active when damage-associated signals are triggered. These cells are resistant to cell death. They can also release tissue damaging, senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). This means these cells release high levels of inflammatory (infection-fighting) cells. The authors of this report recently reported that a protein associated with the coronavirus or virus for COVID-19 (a viral, breathing-related disease) can increase SASP within cultured (grown within a lab) human cells. Additionally, the authors reported that a specific strain of mouse coronavirus increases SASP and the amount of senescent cells within sickened mice. In this study, the authors demonstrate that COVID-19 causes cells to become senescent and overactive SASP in human senescent cells through a specific immune system receptor known as Toll-like receptor-3 (TLR-3). Immune receptors are structures that bind to the surface of a cell and causes a response. TLR-3 can detect virus RNA or genetic material. TLR-3 was increased in human senescent cells compared to those not in a state of senescence. The blocking of TLR-3 prevented senescence causation and SASP amplification from occurring following COVID-19 or Spike pseudo-typed virus (a virus manipulated to not replicate). An artificial TLR-3 agonist, a substance that induces a specific response similar to the original, was not strong enough to induce or cause senescence. However, it did amplify SASP in senescent human cells. Consistent with these findings, the amount of senescent cells within lungs was increased in patients who died from acute COVID-19 infection when compared to patients who passed away for other reasons. These results suggest increased cell senescence and SASP through TLR-3 contributed to COVID-19 death. This indicates that clinical trials of senolytics (drugs that only kill senescent cells) or SASP/TLR-3 inhibitors or blockers are needed. These trials may help reduce short- and long-term effects of COVID-19.",1,B
28,34585235,"Some studies reported that genomic RNA of SARS-CoV-2 can absorb a few host miRNAs that regulate immune-related genes and then deprive their function. In this perspective, we conjecture that the absorption of the SARS-CoV-2 genome to host miRNAs is not a coincidence, which may be an indispensable approach leading to viral survival and development in host. In our study, we collected five datasets of miRNAs that were predicted to interact with the genome of SARS-CoV-2. The targets of these miRNAs in the five groups were consistently enriched immune-related pathways and virus-infectious diseases. Interestingly, the five datasets shared no one miRNA but their targets shared 168 genes. The signaling pathway enrichment of 168 shared targets implied an unbalanced immune response that the most of interleukin signaling pathways and none of the interferon signaling pathways were significantly different. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network using the shared targets showed that PPI pairs, including IL6-IL6R, were related to the process of SARS-CoV-2 infection and pathogenesis. In addition, we found that SARS-CoV-2 absorption to host miRNA could benefit two popular mutant strains for more infectivity and pathogenicity. Conclusively, our results suggest that genomic RNA absorption to host miRNAs may be a vital approach by which SARS-CoV-2 disturbs the host immune system and infects host cells.","Some scientific reports have stated that RNA, or genetic material, from COVID-19 virus (a virus leading to lung infection) can absorb microRNA (small chains of RNA that cannot be coded into proteins) from the host. MiRNA can regulate immune system-related genes. When the virus absorbs this miRNA, it can deprive the genes of their ability to function. Using this knowledge, the authors hypothesized or theorized that the absorption of COVID-19 genetic material to host miRNA is not a coincidence. Therefore, this may be a pathway in which the virus survives and replicates within a host. In this study, the authors collected five datasets of miRNAs that were predicted to interact with the COVID-19 genetic material. The targets of the selected miRNA were pathways related to immune response and virus-infectious diseases. Interestingly, the five datasets had no repeated miRNA, but their targets shared 168 genes. A test analyzing the 168 shared targets implied an unbalanced immune response where most of the interleukin (a messenger protein) signaling pathways and none of the interferon (another messenger protein) signaling pathways were significantly different. A second test using the shared targets show protein-protein interaction pairs, including IL6 to IL6R. The test showed the pairs are related to the process of COVID-19 infection and development. Additionally, the authors found that COVID-19 absorption to host miRNA could help two popular viral strains to infect more and cause more damage in hosts. These results suggest that the absorption of viral RNA to host miRNAs may be a way that COVID-19 disturbs the host immune system and infects host cells.",1,B
28,34579572,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has raised concerns about the detrimental effects of antibodies. Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection is one of the biggest concerns in terms of not only the antibody reaction to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) upon reinfection with the virus but also the reaction to COVID-19 vaccines. In this study, we evaluated ADE of infection by using COVID-19 convalescent-phase plasma and BHK cells expressing human Fcγ receptors (FcγRs). We found that FcγRIIA and FcγRIIIA mediated modest ADE of infection against SARS-CoV-2. Although ADE of infection was observed in monocyte-derived macrophages infected with SARS-CoV-2, including its variants, proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine expression was not upregulated in macrophages.

IMPORTANCE Viruses infect cells mainly via specific receptors at the cell surface. Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection is an alternative mechanism of infection for viruses to infect immune cells that is mediated by antibodies and IgG receptors (FcγRs).

Antibodies are proteins used by the immune system to identify and neutralize viruses. Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) is a unique occurrence in which virus-specific antibodies actually increase entrance of the virus into the host. ADE is a big concern for both people who are exposed to COVID-19 and those who receive the vaccine. In this study, the authors evaluated ADE of infection by using COVID-19 convalescent-phase plasma (a specific of plasma often used to treat infections) and human cells expressing Fcγ receptors (FcγRs), special receptors on infection-fighting cells. The authors found two Fcγ receptors mediated or controlled most ADE of infection against COVID-19. Although ADE of infection was found in macrophages (a white blood cell) infected with COVID-19, and its variants, proteins that increase inflammation were not upregulated or increased. COVID-19 creates antibodies that cause ADE of infection. However, these antibodies do not increase inflammatory or infection-fighting responses by macrophages.

ADE is mediated by antibodies and FcγRs. Because ADE of infection contributes to the development of some viruses, it is import to better understand the exact way ADE contributes to COVID-19 progression. In this study, using plasma or blood from COVID-19 patients, we found that two types of Fcγ receptors mediate ADE of COVID-19 infection.

ADE of infection or improvement of infection is another method of infection for viruses to infect immune cells influenced by antibodies and certain cellular molecules. Because ADE of infection leads to disease symptoms of some viruses, understanding how ADE works and leads to these symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 is important. Using blood from COVID-19 patients, we found two cellular molecules that influence ADE of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

29,34579048,"SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with diverse clinical manifestations, immune dysfunction, and gut microbiota alterations. The nutritional and biochemical quality of one's diet can influence the intestinal microbiota, which may play a role in the defense mechanisms against potential pathogens, by promoting a wide variety of immune-host interactions. In the COVID-19 pandemic, besides the development of pharmacological therapies, a healthy balanced diet, rich with food-derived antioxidants, may be a useful strategy. Many studies demonstrated that vitamins and probiotic therapies have positive effects on the treatment and prevention of oxidative stress and inflammation in COVID-19. The ecology of the gut microbiota in the digestive tract has been linked to the transport function of the host receptor known as angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), suggesting that COVID-19 may be related to the gut microbiota. The angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), and its receptor (ACE2), play central roles in modulating the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). In addition, ACE2 has functions that act independently of the RAS. ACE2 is the receptor for the SARS coronavirus, and ACE2 is essential for the expression of neutral amino acid transporters in the gut. In this context, ACE2 modulates innate immunity and influences the composition of the gut microbiota. Malnutrition is one of the leading underlying causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide and, including comorbidities, may be a major cause of worse outcomes and higher mortality among COVID-19 patients. This paper reviews the research on dietary components, with particular emphasis on vitamins, antioxidants, and probiotic therapies, and their impacts on the intestinal microbiota's diversity during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","Coronavirus infection (a viral, respiratory disease) is associated with different types of symptoms, as well as damage to the immune system and changes in gut microbiota, which are important microorganisms in the digestive system that process food and help the body use nutrients. The nutrition and chemical processes of one's diet can alter the microbiota in the stomach, which may play a role in the body's ability to fight possible infections. In the Covid-19 pandemic, besides developing medicines and vaccines, a healthy diet with antioxidants (vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients that protect and repair cells) may be a useful option. Many studies show that vitamins and probiotic (good bacteria) therapies have positive effects on the treatment and prevention of oxidative stress (a condition that happens when antioxidant levels are low leading to cell and tissue damage) and inflammation (redness and swelling from fighting an infection) in Covid-19. Research on the relationship between the gut microbiota in the digestive system and its environment is linked to the protein receptor of the cell surface that allows the virus to enter, called ACE2, suggesting that Covid-19 may be linked to the gut microbiota. The protein and its ACE2 receptor that allows viruses to attach to cells play central roles in controlling the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), which is the system that regulates blood pressure and fluids in the body. In addition, ACE2 has functions that act without influence by the RAS. ACE2 is the receptor for the SARS coronavirus that causes COVID-19, and ACE2 is essential for the production of amino acids (molecules that form proteins) in the gut. In this instance, ACE2 controls natural immunity or infection prevention and influences what substances make up the gut microbiota.

29,34578229,"Previously, we reported that immunomodulatory lactobacilli, nasally administered, beneficially regulated the lung antiviral innate immune response induced by Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) activation and improved protection against the respiratory pathogens, influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus in mice. Here, we assessed the immunomodulatory effects of viable and non-viable Lactiplantibacillus plantarum strains in human respiratory epithelial cells (Calu-3 cells) and the capacity of these immunobiotic lactobacilli to reduce their susceptibility to the acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Immunobiotic L. plantarum MPL16 and CRL1506 differentially modulated IFN-β, IL-6, CXCL8, CCL5 and CXCL10 production and IFNAR2, DDX58, Mx1 and OAS1 expression in Calu-3 cells stimulated with the TLR3 agonist poly(I:C). Furthermore, the MPL16 and CRL1506 strains increased the resistance of Calu-3 cells to the challenge with SARS-CoV-2. L. plantarum MPL16 induced these beneficial effects more efficiently than the CRL1506 strain. Of note, neither non-viable MPL16 and CRL1506 strains nor the non-immunomodulatory strains L. plantarum CRL1905 and MPL18 could modify the resistance of Calu-3 cells to SARS-CoV-2 infection or the immune response to poly(I:C) challenge. To date, the potential beneficial effects of immunomodulatory probiotics on SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 outcome have been extrapolated from studies carried out in the context of other viral pathogens. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the ability of immunomodulatory lactobacilli to positively influence the replication of the new coronavirus. Further mechanistic studies and in vivo experiments in animal models of SARS-CoV-2 infection are necessary to identify specific strains of beneficial immunobiotic lactobacilli like L. plantarum MPL16 or CRL1506 for the prevention or treatment of the COVID-19.","Lactobacilli is a type of probiotic (good bacteria) found in the digestive system and can be consumed to improve gut health. When lactobacilli is given through a spray in the nose in mice, it can help regulate the natural immune or infection-fighting response in the lungs and fight lung infections. Lactobacilli bacteria that comes from plants is tested to see how it impacts the immune systems of the cells in the lungs and if it can reduce the ability of the coronavirus (a virus causing COVID-19 - a lung infection) from entering the cells. Two types of lactobacilli bacteria that come from plants, called MPL16 and CRL506, are tested to understand their influence on the production of cells that are part of the immune response and the development of proteins. Additionally, these two types of bacteria increase the resistance of certain cells in the lungs called Calu-3 against the coronavirus. The lactobacilli MPL16 bacteria started these beneficial effects more efficiently than the CRL1506. No lactobacilli bacteria from the tested plants can change the resistance of Calu-3 cells to coronavirus infection. As of now, the possible benefits of good bacteria (probiotics) on the immune system against the coronavirus and Covid-19 have been pulled from studies of other viruses.

29,32784601,"Objectives: The novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19) conveys a serious threat globally to health and economy because of a lack of vaccines and specific treatments. A common factor for conditions that predispose for serious progress is a low-grade inflammation, e.g., as seen in metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and heart failure, to which micronutrient deficiencies may contribute. The aim of the present article was to explore the usefulness of early micronutrient intervention, with focus on zinc, selenium, and vitamin D, to relieve escalation of COVID-19. Methods: We conducted an online search for articles published in the period 2010-2020 on zinc, selenium, and vitamin D, and corona and related virus infections. Results: There were a few studies providing direct evidence on associations between zinc, selenium, and vitamin D, and COVID-19. Adequate supply of zinc, selenium, and vitamin D is essential for resistance to other viral infections, immune function, and reduced inflammation. Hence, it is suggested that nutrition intervention securing an adequate status might protect against the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome - coronavirus-2) and mitigate the course of COVID-19. Conclusion: We recommended initiation of adequate supplementation in high-risk areas and/or soon after the time of suspected infection with SARS-CoV-2.

The aim of this paper is to explore the usefulness of starting certain vitamins and minerals early, especially zinc, selenium (a mineral found in water and foods), and vitamin D, to keep Covid-19 infections from becoming more serious.

29,32911778,"The pandemic caused by the new coronavirus has caused shock waves in many countries, producing a global health crisis worldwide. Lack of knowledge of the biological mechanisms of viruses, plus the absence of effective treatments against the disease (COVID-19) and/or vaccines have pulled factors that can compromise the proper functioning of the immune system to fight against infectious diseases into the spotlight. The optimal status of specific nutrients is considered crucial to keeping immune components within their normal activity, helping to avoid and overcome infections. Specifically, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) evaluated and deems six vitamins (D, A, C, Folate, B6, B12) and four minerals (zinc, iron, copper and selenium) to be essential for the normal functioning of the immune system, due to the scientific evidence collected so far. In this report, an update on the evidence of the contribution of nutritional factors as immune-enhancing aspects, factors that could reduce their bioavailability, and the role of the optimal status of these nutrients within the COVID-19 pandemic context was carried out. First, a non-systematic review of the current state of knowledge regarding the impact of an optimal nutritional status of these nutrients on the proper functioning of the immune system as well as their potential role in COVID-19 prevention/treatment was carried out by searching for available scientific evidence in PubMed and LitCovid databases. Second, a compilation from published sources and an analysis of nutritional data from 10 European countries was performed, and the relationship between country nutritional status and epidemiological COVID-19 data (available in the Worldometers database) was evaluated following an ecological study design. Furthermore, the potential effect of genetics was considered through the selection of genetic variants previously identified in Genome-Wide Association studies (GWAs) as influencing the nutritional status of these 10 considered nutrients. Therefore, access to genetic information in accessible databases (1000genomes, by Ensembl) of individuals from European populations enabled an approximation that countries might present a greater risk of suboptimal status of the nutrients studied. Results from the review approach show the importance of maintaining a correct nutritional status of these 10 nutrients analyzed for the health of the immune system, highlighting the importance of Vitamin D and iron in the context of COVID-19. Besides, the ecological study demonstrates that intake levels of relevant micronutrients-especially Vitamins D, C, B12, and iron-are inversely associated with higher COVID-19 incidence and/or mortality, particularly in populations genetically predisposed to show lower micronutrient status. In conclusion, nutrigenetic data provided by joint assessment of 10 essential nutrients for the functioning of the immune system and of the genetic factors that can limit their bioavailability can be a fundamental tool to help strengthen the immune system of individuals and prepare populations to fight against infectious diseases such as COVID-19.","The pandemic caused by the new coronavirus (which causes COVID-19 - a viral, breathing-related illness) has caused shock waves in many countries, producing a global health crisis. Lack of knowledge of how the virus works, plus the absence of effective treatments against Covid-19 and/or vaccines have put the immune system and its ability to fight disease in the spotlight. Having a healthy balance of specific nutrients is key to keeping parts of the immune system working in order to avoid and fight infections. There are 6 vitamins (D, A, C, Folate, B6, B12) and 4 minerals (zinc, iron, copper and selenium) that the European Food Safety Authority sees as important for the immune system to function well. In this report is an update on the evidence of 1) how nutrition impacts the immune system, 2) what things might reduce how long nutrients stay in the body, and 3) the role of the healthy balance of these nutrients during the Covid-19 pandemic. First, researchers review available scientific data on the impact of a healthy balance of these nutrients on the immune system, as well as their role in Covid-19 prevention and treatment. Second, nutrition data from 10 European countries are compiled and analyzed, and the relationship between country nutrition and Covid-19 data is evaluated. Additionally, the possible effect of genes on nutrient balance is considered for these 10 nutrients. Using genetic information from available databases, researchers estimated that countries may be at a greater risk of low nutritional balance. Results from the review show the importance of keeping a correct nutritional balance of these 10 nutrients for the health of the immune system and highlights the importance of Vitamin D and iron in the context of Covid-19. The study of these nutrients and their environment shows that the amount consumed of certain vitamins and minerals-especially Vitamins D, C, B12, and iron-are inversely or oppositely associated with higher Covid-19 numbers and/or death (i.e., the higher the nutrition, the lower the risk of Covid-19 illness and vice versa). This finding is very important for groups with genes shown to lower micronutrient status. In conclusion, using nutritional and genetic data and how they influence the immune system and how long nutrients stay in the body can be key tools to help strengthen the immune system of individuals and prepare people to fight viruses such as Covid-19.",1,C

Study selection: Studies were included if they examined tardive dyskinesia treatment as the primary outcome and were randomized and placebo-controlled trials. Data extraction: The effect size (standard mean difference) of improvement (compared to placebo) stratified by medication class is reported for each of the trials included in this systematic review. A meta-analysis was conducted utilizing a fixed-effects model. Results: Vitamin E was associated with significantly greater reduction in TD symptoms compared to placebo (standardized mean difference [SMD] = 0.31 ± 0.08; 95% CI, 0.16 to 0.46; z = 4.1; P < .001).

Regarding reduction in total Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) scores (primary outcome), both deutetrabenazine (k=2, n=413, standardized mean difference [SMD] =-0.40, 95% confidence interval [CI] =-0.19, -0.62, p<0.001; weighted mean difference (WMD) =-1.44, 95% CI =-0.67, -2.19, p<0.001) and valbenazine (k=4, n=421, SMD =-0.58, 95% CI =-0.26, -0.91, p<0.001; WMD =-2.07, 95% CI =-1.08, -3.05, p<0.001) significantly outperformed placebo. Results were confirmed regarding responder rates (≥50% AIMS total score reduction; deutetrabenazine: risk ratio [RR] =2.13, 95% CI =1.10, 4.12, p=0.024, number-needed-to-treat [NNT] =7, 95% CI =3, 333, p=0.046; valbenazine: RR =3.05, 95% CI =1.81, 5.11, p<0.001, NNT =4, 95% CI =3, 6, p<0.001). Less consistent results emerged from patient-rated global impression-based response (p=0.15) and clinical global impression for deutetrabenazine (p=0.088), and for clinical global impression change for valbenazine (p=0.67). In an open-label extension (OLE) study of deutetrabenazine (≤54 weeks) and a dose-blinded valbenazine study (≤48 weeks), responder rates increased over time. With valbenazine, discontinuation effects were studied, showing TD symptom recurrence towards baseline severity levels within 4 weeks after valbenazine withdrawal. No increased cumulative or specific adverse (AEs) events versus placebo (acute trials) in extension versus acute trial data were observed. Conclusion: The 2 VMAT-2 inhibitors, valbenazine and deutetrabenazine, are effective in treating TD, both acutely and long-term, without concerns about increased risk of depression or suicide in the TD population.

We searched for published scientific studies, including studies that summarized other studies, used statistics to combine results from other studies, or randomly assigned participants to groups receiving TD treatment or sugar pills that looked at how well treatments worked and safety of VMAT-2 inhibitors (tetrabenazine, deutetrabenazine, and valbenazine) in patients with TD. We used statistical methods to determine how well treatments work and safety results across multiple studies. We used statistical methods to combine results from two 12-week studies with deutetrabenazine 12-48 mg/day (413 patients) and four 4-6 week studies with valbenazine 12.5-100 mg/day (488 patients). No high-quality data were available for tetrabenazine for a similar analysis. Results favored deutetrabenazine and valbenazine over sugar pills in scores on a rating scale that measures involuntary movements (AIMS). The percentage of patients who had 50% reduction in scores on the same rating scale (AIMS) favored deutetrabenazine and valbenazine over sugar pills. Results were less consistent using another rating scale done by patients and doctors for deutetrabenazine and by doctors for valbenazine. In one study of deutetrabenazine and one study of valbenazine, the percentage of patients who had a 50% reduction in scores on the AIMS rating scale went up over time. Effects of stopping valbenazine were studied, showing TD symptoms returning to levels before stopping valbenazine within 4 weeks of stopping the drug. No increased unfavorable and unintended effects were observed in studies where participants continued to take the studied drug compared to sugar pills. We conclude that the 2 VMAT-2 inhibitors, valbenazine and deutetrabenazine, work to treat TD, both in the short- and long-term, without causing increased risk of depression or suicide in people with TD. No studies comparing VMAT-2 inhibitors or high-quality tetrabenazine data that could be compared across studies were available.",1,C

However, the effect of other antihypertensive drugs on plasma Hcy levels has not been tested extensively. The aim of present study was to investigate the effect of antihypertensive therapy (AHT) on Hcy levels in essential hypertensive subjects. A case-control study of 273 patients with essential hypertension (EH) and 103 normotensive controls was undertaken. Plasma Hcy levels were measured before and after 6 weeks of AHT. The genotyping of MTHFR C677T polymorphism was performed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-blockers significantly decreased and hydrochlorothiazides significantly increased the plasma Hcy levels in hypertensive patients (P<0.05). No significant association between MTHFR C677T genotypes and changes in Hcy levels in response to antihypertensive was observed in EH patients. The decrease in Hcy induced by beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors observed in our study may be due to the improvement of endothelial function along with improved renal function. Thus, our results suggest that ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers may provide additional beneficial therapeutic effects to the EH patients by decreasing Hcy levels.","Recent studies have shown that antihypertensive drugs (that treat high blood pressure), like diuretics, increase plasma or blood homocysteine (Hcy) levels.

Patients were genotyped to analyze a specific genetic variation or gene material. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are drugs that lower blood pressure by relaxing veins and arteries. Beta-blockers are drugs that lower blood pressure by blocking the effects of adrenaline. ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers significantly decrease plasms Hcy levels in hypertensive patients. Hydrochlorothiazides, or ""water pills"", significantly increase plasms Hcy levels in hypertensive patients. There was no association between the identified genetic variation and changes in Hcy levels in response to antihypertensive within EH patients. The observed decrease in Hcy caused by ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers may be due to the improvement of endothelial (tissue lining various organs and cavities in the body) and kidney function.

C677T polymorphism in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene (MTHFR) is a major determinant of hyperhomocysteinemia, which results in endothelial dysfunction. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors appear to remedy the endothelial dysfunction and restore endothelium-dependent vasodilatation. The co-existence of genetic polymorphisms in drug metabolizing enzymes, targets, receptors, and transporters may influence the drug efficacy. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether short-term blood pressure control by benazepril, an ACE inhibitor, was modulated by C677T MTHFR gene polymorphism. Methods and results: A total of 444 hypertensive patients, aged 27 to 65 years, without any anti hypertensive therapy within 2 weeks were included. All of them were treated orally with benazepril at a single daily fixed dosage of 10 mg for 15 consecutive days. Blood pressures were measured at baseline and on the 16th day of treatment. Among them, the frequency of MTHFR C677T genotype CC, CT and TT was 24.3%, 51.8%, and 23.9%, respectively. In a recessive model (CC+CT versus TT genotype), both baseline diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and diastolic blood pressure response (DeltaDBP) were significantly higher in patients with the TT genotype than in those with the CT or CC genotype (P value=0.0076 for DBP, and P value=0.0005 for DeltaDBP). We further divided all patients into three groups based on the tertiles of the DeltaBP distribution. Compared to subjects in the lowest tertile of DeltaDBP, the adjusted relative odds of having the TT genotype among subjects in the highest tertile was 2.6 (95% CI, 1.4 to 4.9). However, baseline systolic blood pressure (SBP) and SBP response did not significantly associate with MTHFR C677T polymorphism. Conclusions: Our finding suggests that MTHFR C667T polymorphism modulated baseline DBP and DBP responsiveness by short-term treatment of ACE inhibitor in Chinese essential hypertensive patients.","Increase plasma, or blood, homocysteine has been identified as a risk factor for hypertension (high blood pressure). Homocysteine is a chemical your body produces to help make proteins. An identified genetic variation or gene type within the human population is a major determinant of hyperhomocysteinemia. Hyperhomocysteinemia is a condition with excess homocysteine in the blood. The condition can result in endothelial dysfunction, or a heart disease where the blood vessels narrow instead of opening. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are a type of drug commonly used to treat high blood pressure. ACE Inhibitors appear to fix the endothelial (or blood vessel lining) dysfunction and allow blood vessels to open. The presence of the genetic variation in specific bodily locations that metabolize or digest drugs, such as enzymes and receptors, may influence how well a drug works. The goal of this study was to investigate if short-term blood pressure control by an ACE inhibitor (Benazepril) is effected by the identified genetic variation. A total of 444 hypertensive patients, aged 27 to 65 years, without any anti hypertensive therapy within 2 weeks were included. All patients were treated with Benazepril with a single, daily dose of 10 mg for 15 consecutive days. Blood pressures were measured prior to the study beginning (baseline) and on the 16th day of treatment. The unique genetic variation has three unique ""versions"" or genotypes, known as CC, CT, or TT. Among the patients, the frequency of the genetic variation genotype CC, CT, and TT was 24.3%, 51.8%, and 23.9%, respectively. In a statistical analysis, several blood pressure measurements were higher in patients with the TT genotype than those with the CT or CC genotype. The authors further divided all patients into three groups based on where their diastolic blood pressure response (DeltaDBP) fell within a population scale. Diastolic blood pressure is the lowest pressure when the heart is relaxed. Patients with the highest DeltaDBP had the highest chance of having the TT genotype. However, baseline systolic blood pressure (when the heart is contracting) was not significantly associated with the unique genetic variation. This study suggests that the unique genetic variation altered baseline DBP by short-term treatment of ACE inhibitor in hypertensive patients.",1,B

A specific mutation in DNA (C677T) encoding methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), a protein that transforms homocysteine, greatly influences hyperhomocysteinemia, or high blood levels of homocysteine. This condition results in damage to cells that line the heart and blood vessels. Blood pressure medication called angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors seem to repair damage to cells lining the heart and blood vessels and restore blood vessel widening. The co-existence of varied DNA for drug-digesting enzymes, targets, target sites, and transporters may affect drug effect. This study investigates if short-term blood pressure control by benazepril, an ACE inhibitor, was affected by variation in the DNA sequence for the C667T MTHFR gene. 444 patients with high blood pressure, aged 27 to 65 years, without any high blood pressure therapy within 2 weeks were included. All of them swallowed benazepril at a single daily fixed dose of 10 mg for 15 consecutive days. Blood pressures were measured at start and on the 16th day of treatment. Among them, the gene sequence for MTHFR C677T varied. Diastolic blood pressure at the start and end were much higher for patients with a certain DNA sequence for the MTHFR C677T gene than patients with two other DNA sequences. We then divided all patients into 3 groups based on the distribution of blood pressure readings at the study's end. Compared to those with the lowest blood pressure measurements, the chances of having a certain DNA sequence for the MTHFR C667T gene among those with the highest blood pressure readings was 2.6 times higher. However, systolic blood pressure at the start and end was not linked to DNA sequences.

Approach and results: This analysis included 16 413 participants from the CSPPT, who were randomly assigned to 2 double-blind treatment groups: either 10-mg enalapril+0.8-mg folic acid or 10-mg enalapril, daily and had individual measurements of serum folate and tHcy levels at baseline and exit visits and MTHFR C677T genotypes. Mean baseline tHcy levels were comparable between the 2 treatment groups (14.5±8.5 versus 14.4±8.1 μmol/L; P=0.561). After 4.5 years of treatment, mean tHcy levels were reduced to 12.7±6.1 μmol/L in the enalapril+folic acid group, but almost stayed the same in the enalapril group (14.4±7.9 μmol/L, group difference: 1.61 μmol/L; 11% reduction). More importantly, tHcy lowering varied by MTHFR genotypes and serum folate levels. Compared with CC and CT genotypes, participants with the TT genotype had a more prominent L-shaped curve between tHcy and serum folate levels and required higher folate levels (at least 15 ng/mL) to eliminate the differences in tHcy by genotypes. Conclusions: Compared with CC or CT, tHcy in the TT group manifested a heightened L-shaped curve from low to high folate levels, but this difference in tHcy by genotype was eliminated when plasma folate levels reach ≈15 ng/mL or higher. Our data raised the prospect to tailor folic acid therapy according to individual MTHFR C677T genotype and folate status.","This study represents an analysis on the China Stroke Primary Prevention Trial (CSPPT).

32,33172445,"Background: Genome-wide and clinical studies have linked the 677C→T polymorphism in the gene encoding methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) with hypertension, whilst limited evidence shows that intervention with riboflavin (i.e. the MTHFR co-factor) can lower blood pressure (BP) in hypertensive patients with the variant MTHFR 677TT genotype. We investigated the impact of this common polymorphism on BP throughout adulthood and hypothesised that riboflavin status would modulate the genetic risk of hypertension. Methods: Observational data on 6076 adults of 18-102 years were drawn from the Joint Irish Nutrigenomics Organisation project, comprising the Trinity-Ulster Department of Agriculture (TUDA; volunteer sample) and the National Adult Nutrition Survey (NANS; population-based sample) cohorts. Participants were recruited from the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland (UK) in 2008-2012 using standardised methods. Results: The variant MTHFR 677TT genotype was identified in 12% of adults. From 18 to 70 years, this genotype was associated with an increased risk of hypertension (i.e. systolic BP ≥ 140 and/or a diastolic BP ≥ 90 mmHg): odds ratio (OR) 1.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07 to 1.90; P = 0.016, after adjustment for antihypertensive drug use and other significant factors, namely, age, male sex, BMI, alcohol and total cholesterol. Low or deficient biomarker status of riboflavin (observed in 30.2% and 30.0% of participants, respectively) exacerbated the genetic risk of hypertension, with a 3-fold increased risk for the TT genotype in combination with deficient riboflavin status (OR 3.00, 95% CI, 1.34-6.68; P = 0.007) relative to the CC genotype combined with normal riboflavin status. Up to 65 years, we observed poorer BP control rates on antihypertensive treatment in participants with the TT genotype (30%) compared to those without this variant, CT (37%) and CC (45%) genotypes (P < 0.027). Conclusions: The MTHFR 677TT genotype is associated with higher BP independently of homocysteine and predisposes adults to an increased risk of hypertension and poorer BP control with antihypertensive treatment, whilst better riboflavin status is associated with a reduced genetic risk. Riboflavin intervention may thus offer a personalised approach to prevent the onset of hypertension in adults with the TT genotype; however, this requires confirmation in a randomised trial in non-hypertensive adults.","Research has linked a specific a genetic variation or gene change, known as 677C→T, within the gene encoding methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR - a blood-pressure-related protein) with hypertension (high blood pressure).

Low or deficient levels of riboflavin increased the genetic risk of hypertension. Participants with 677TT genotype and a riboflavin deficiency have a 3-fold higher risk of developing hypertension. In participants up to 65 years, the authors observed poorer BP control rates on antihypertensive treatment in participants with the TT genotype compared to participants with other genotypes (CC or CT). The study concluded the MTHFR 677TT genotype is associated with higher BP independently of homocysteine levels. Homocysteine is a chemical your body produces to help make proteins. Additionally, the MTHFR 677TT genotype makes people more likely to have an increased risk of hypertension and poorer BP control with antihypertensive treatment. Better riboflavin status was associated with a reduced genetic risk for hypertension. Riboflavin administration or use may offer a personalized or unique approach to prevent the onset or start of hypertension in adults with the TT genotype. However, this requires more researched in non-hypertensive adults.",1,B
32,33172445,"Background: Genome-wide and clinical studies have linked the 677C→T polymorphism in the gene encoding methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) with hypertension, whilst limited evidence shows that intervention with riboflavin (i.e. the MTHFR co-factor) can lower blood pressure (BP) in hypertensive patients with the variant MTHFR 677TT genotype. We investigated the impact of this common polymorphism on BP throughout adulthood and hypothesised that riboflavin status would modulate the genetic risk of hypertension. Methods: Observational data on 6076 adults of 18-102 years were drawn from the Joint Irish Nutrigenomics Organisation project, comprising the Trinity-Ulster Department of Agriculture (TUDA; volunteer sample) and the National Adult Nutrition Survey (NANS; population-based sample) cohorts. Participants were recruited from the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland (UK) in 2008-2012 using standardised methods. Results: The variant MTHFR 677TT genotype was identified in 12% of adults. From 18 to 70 years, this genotype was associated with an increased risk of hypertension (i.e. systolic BP ≥ 140 and/or a diastolic BP ≥ 90 mmHg): odds ratio (OR) 1.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07 to 1.90; P = 0.016, after adjustment for antihypertensive drug use and other significant factors, namely, age, male sex, BMI, alcohol and total cholesterol. Low or deficient biomarker status of riboflavin (observed in 30.2% and 30.0% of participants, respectively) exacerbated the genetic risk of hypertension, with a 3-fold increased risk for the TT genotype in combination with deficient riboflavin status (OR 3.00, 95% CI, 1.34-6.68; P = 0.007) relative to the CC genotype combined with normal riboflavin status. Up to 65 years, we observed poorer BP control rates on antihypertensive treatment in participants with the TT genotype (30%) compared to those without this variant, CT (37%) and CC (45%) genotypes (P < 0.027). Conclusions: The MTHFR 677TT genotype is associated with higher BP independently of homocysteine and predisposes adults to an increased risk of hypertension and poorer BP control with antihypertensive treatment, whilst better riboflavin status is associated with a reduced genetic risk. Riboflavin intervention may thus offer a personalised approach to prevent the onset of hypertension in adults with the TT genotype; however, this requires confirmation in a randomised trial in non-hypertensive adults.","Genetic and clinical studies have linked variation in a specific DNA sequence for methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), a certain protein, with high blood pressure. Some evidence shows that treatment with riboflavin (a molecule that attaches to MTHFR) can lower blood pressure (BP) in patients with high blood pressure and an altered DNA sequence for MTHFR called 677TT. We tested the impact of this altered DNA sequence on BP through adulthood. We believed that riboflavin would affect the genetic risk of high blood pressure. Patients were recruited from the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland in 2008-2012. The altered DNA sequence of MTHFR 677TT was found in 12% of adults. From 18 to 70 years, this altered DNA sequence, or genotype, was linked with increased risk of high blood pressure after adjusting for blood pressure medication use, age, sex, body mass, alcohol, total cholesterol, and other factors. Low or no riboflavin (seen in 30.2% and 30.0% of participants, respectively) worsened the genetic risk of high blood pressure. Patients with a certain genotype along with no riboflavin had a 3-fold increased risk compared to patients with the standard genotype along with normal riboflavin. Up to 65 years, we saw poorer BP control rates on anti-high-BP treatment in participants with a certain DNA sequence for MTHFR compared to those without this altered DNA sequence. A specific gentoype for MTHFR is linked with higher BP regardless of homocysteine, a molecule that MTHFR acts on, and biases adults to increased risk of high BP and poorer BP control with anti-high-BP treatment. Better riboflavin amount is linked with reduced genetic risk. Riboflavin treatment may thus give an individualized approach to prevent high BP in adults with a certain genotype for MTHFR. Still, this needs confirmation in a trial in adults without high BP.",2,B
32,24131523,"Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is a critical folate-metabolising enzyme which requires riboflavin as its co-factor. A common polymorphism (677C→T) in the MTHFR gene results in reduced MTHFR activity in vivo which in turn leads to impaired folate metabolism and elevated homocysteine concentrations. Homozygosity for this polymorphism (TT genotype) is associated with an increased risk of a number of conditions including heart disease and stroke, but there is considerable variability in the extent of excess risk in various reports. The present review will explore the evidence which supports a role for this polymorphism as a risk factor for a number of adverse health outcomes, and the potential modulating roles for B-vitamins in alleviating disease risk. The evidence is convincing in the case which links this polymorphism with hypertension and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, particularly preeclampsia. Furthermore, elevated blood pressure was found to be highly responsive to riboflavin intervention specifically in individuals with the MTHFR 677TT genotype. Future intervention studies targeted at these genetically predisposed individuals are required to further investigate this novel gene-nutrient interaction. This polymorphism has also been associated with an increased risk of neural tube defects (NTD) and other adverse pregnancy outcomes; however, the evidence in this area has been inconsistent. Preliminary evidence has suggested that there may be a much greater need for women with the MTHFR 677TT genotype to adhere to the specific recommendation of commencing folic acid prior to conception for the prevention of NTD, but this requires further investigation.","Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is a critical folate (specific vitamin)-metabolizing enzyme which requires riboflavin as its co-factor. Co-factors are needed for enzymes, catalysts for chemical reactions in the body, to complete their roles. A common variation (677C→T) in the MTHFR gene results in reduced MTHFR activity. This can caused impaired folate metabolism and increased homocysteine concentrations. Homocysteine is a chemical your body produces to help make proteins. Individuals can inherit the same form of a gene from both parents. When this occurs, a person has homozygosity. Homozygosity for this genetic variation (TT genotype) is associated with an increased risk of a number of conditions. These conditions include heart disease and stroke. However, there is a large amount of variability or differences in the extent of excess risk in various reports. The study aimed to explore the evidence available that supports this genetic variation increasing the risk for several adverse or bad health outcomes.

The C677T 5, 10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene polymorphism increases homocysteine (HCY) levels. This study analyzed the relationship between C677T MTHFR polymorphism and the therapeutic effect of lowering HCY in stroke patients with HHCY. Methods: Baseline data were collected from stroke patients with HHCY for this prospective cohort study. The C677T MTHFR genotype was detected by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism and the therapeutic effect to reduce HCY was compared. Results: Of 200 stroke patients 162 (81.0%) completed follow-up and were evaluated. Most of them responded well to treatment (103 cases, 63.5%), but 59 (36.4%) patients were in the poor efficacy group. There was a significant difference in terms of age (P < 0.001), hypertension (P = 0.041), hyperuricemia (P = 0.042), HCY after treatment (P < 0.001), and MTHFR genotype (P < 0.001) between the poor efficacy and effective groups, with increased frequency of the TT genotype in the poor efficacy group. Logistic regression showed that the T allele was associated with poor efficacy (OR = 0.733, 95%CI: 0.693, 0.862, P < 0.001). In the codominant model the TT genotype was associated with poor outcome (OR = 0.862, 95%CI: 0.767, 0.970, P = 0.017) and this was also the case in the recessive model (OR = 0.585, 95%CI: 0.462, 0.741, P < 0.001) but there was no association between CT and TT in the dominant model. Conclusions: The T allele and TT genotype of the MTHFR C677T polymorphism was associated with poor HCY reduction treatment efficacy in stroke patients with HHCY.","Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHCY), when there is excess homocysteine in the blood, is a risk factor for cardiovascular, or blood- and heart-related, and cerebrovascular, or blood- and brain-related, diseases.

A specific genetic variation or gene change, known as C677T 5, 10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene polymorphism, which alters the MTHFR protein involved in blood pressure, increases homocysteine (HCY) levels. This study analyzed the relationship between C677T MTHFR variation and the therapeutic, beneficial effect (response after a treatment) of lowering HCY in stroke patients with HHCY. Baseline data, meaning prior to treatment, was collected from stroke patients with HHCY for this study. The C677T MTHFR genotype was detected, and the therapeutic effect to reduce HCY was compared. Of 200 stroke patients, 162 completed follow-up and were evaluated. Most of them responded well to treatment, but 59 patients were in the poor efficacy or poor effect group. There was a significant difference in terms of age, hypertension (high blood pressure), hyperuricemia (high uric acid or waste), HCY after treatment, and MTHFR genotype between the poor efficacy and effective groups. The poor efficacy group had more participated with TT genotype of the genetic variant. Statistical analysis showed that the T allele (an alternative form of a gene) was associated with poor efficacy.

32,27845713,"Hypertension, a major risk factor for heart disease and stroke, is the world's leading cause of preventable, premature death. A common polymorphism (677C→T) in the gene encoding the folate metabolizing enzyme methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is associated with increased blood pressure, and there is accumulating evidence demonstrating that this phenotype can be modulated, specifically in individuals with the MTHFR 677TT genotype, by the B-vitamin riboflavin, an essential co-factor for MTHFR. The underlying mechanism that links this polymorphism, and the related gene-nutrient interaction, with hypertension is currently unknown. Previous research has shown that 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, the product of the reaction catalysed by MTHFR, appears to be a positive allosteric modulator of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and may thus increase the production of nitric oxide, a potent vasodilator. Blood pressure follows a circadian pattern, peaking shortly after wakening and falling during the night, a phenomenon known as 'dipping'. Any deviation from this pattern, which can only be identified using ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), has been associated with increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. This review will consider the evidence linking this polymorphism and novel gene-nutrient interaction with hypertension and the potential mechanisms that might be involved.

32,23608654,"Intervention with riboflavin was recently shown to produce genotype-specific lowering of blood pressure (BP) in patients with premature cardiovascular disease homozygous for the 677C→ T polymorphism (TT genotype) in the gene encoding the enzyme methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR). Whether this effect is confined to patients with high-risk cardiovascular disease is unknown. The aim of this randomized trial, therefore, was to investigate the responsiveness of BP to riboflavin supplementation in hypertensive individuals with the TT genotype but without overt cardiovascular disease. From an available sample of 1427 patients with hypertension, we identified 157 with the MTHFR 677TT genotype, 91 of whom agreed to participate in the trial. Participants were stratified by systolic BP and randomized to receive placebo or riboflavin (1.6 mg/d) for 16 weeks. At baseline, despite being prescribed multiple classes of antihypertensive drugs, >60% of participants with this genotype had failed to reach goal BP (≤140/90 mm Hg). A significant improvement in the biomarker status of riboflavin was observed in response to intervention (P<0.001). Correspondingly, an overall treatment effect of 5.6±2.6 mm Hg (P=0.033) in systolic BP was observed, with pre- and postintervention values of 141.8±2.9 and 137.1±3.0 mm Hg (treatment group) and 143.5±3.0 and 144.3±3.1 mm Hg (placebo group), whereas the treatment effect in diastolic BP was not significant (P=0.291). In conclusion, these results show that riboflavin supplementation targeted at hypertensive individuals with the MTHFR 677TT genotype can decrease BP more effectively than treatment with current antihypertensive drugs only and indicate the potential for a personalized approach to the management of hypertension in this genetically at-risk group.","Use of riboflavin (a B vitamin) was recently shown to have genotype-specific effects on lowering blood pressure (BP). This means a person's response was different depending on their genetic makeup. This process was shown within patients of premature (or early) cardiovascular (or heart-related) disease with a TT genotype of a specific genetic variation or gene change. This genetic variation, known as 677C, is found within the gene that encodes the enzyme methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR). MTHFR is involved in the processing of amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. It is unknown if this effect is confined to patients with high-risk cardiovascular disease. The goal of this study was to investigate the responsiveness of BP in hypertensive (high blood pressure) patients taking riboflavin. Specifically, these patients would have the TT genotype but no obvious cardiovascular disease. Of 1427 hypertensive patients, the authors identified 157 with the MTHFR 677TT genotype. Ninety-one agreed to participate in the study. Participants were ordered by systolic BP (when the heart contracts and the higher blood pressure number) and randomized to receive a placebo (harmless pill) or riboflavin (1.6 mg/d) for 16 weeks. Before treatment, despite being prescribed multiple classes of antihypertensive drugs, the majority of participants with this genotype had failed to reach the goal BP. A significant improvement in the level of bodily riboflavin was observed in response to intervention or treatment. A significant treatment effect in systolic BP was observed. However, no significant treatment was found in diastolic (when the heart relaxes and the lower blood pressure number) BP. The study concluded riboflavin supplementation within hypertensive individuals with the MTHFR 677TT genotype decreases BP more efficiently than current antihypertensive drugs only.

CTZ treatment resulted in reduced area under the concentration-time curve and peak concentration compared with treatment A. In treatment B, the lower plasma concentrations of GBP resulted in reduced pain attenuation. GBP renal clearance was similar between treatments. GBP has low apparent affinity for OCT2 (concentration of an inhibitor where the response [or binding] is reduced by half [IC50 ] 237 µmol/L) and a high apparent affinity for hMATE1 (IC50 1.1 nmol/L), hMATE2-K (IC50 39 nmol/L), and hOCTN1 (IC50 2.1 nmol/L) in HEK cells. At therapeutic concentrations, CTZ interacts with hMATE1 and OCTN1. In summary, CTZ reduced the systemic exposure to GBP and its effect on neuropathic pain attenuation. However, CTZ × GBP interaction is not mediated by the renal transporters.","Gabapentin (GBP) is a nerve-related pain medication that is mainly removed from the body in urine, and is also processed by the kidneys. The objective of this study is to evaluate how gabapentin may interact with another medicine called cetirizine (CTZ) that is used to temporarily relieve allergies. A clinical trial in patients with a shooting or burning pain caused by damage to the nervous system called neuropathic pain is conducted to understand the effect of cetirizine on how gabapentin is processed in the body. In this study, 12 patients are treated with either one dose of gabapentin (called Treatment A) or with cetirizine for 5 days and gabapentin given on the last day of cetirizine (Treatment B). Blood samples are taken and the level of pain is measured up to 36 hours after gabapentin is taken. The interaction of gabapentin and cetirizine is analyzed. Cetirizine treatment resulted a reduced time the body is exposed to the medication and reduced peak amount when compared with Treatment A (one dose of gabapentin). In treatment B, the lower concentrations of gabapentin or GBP in the blood results in reduced pain. GBP clearance from the kidneys is similar between treatments A and B. GBP appears to bind less to some receptors or kidney target sites such as OCT2 and attach more towards others such as hMATE1 in certain human kidney cells. At certain concentrations, CTZ interacts with transporters in the body that move materials across cells. In summary, cetirizine (CTZ) reduces the exposure to gabapentin (GBP) and its effect on neuropathic pain. However, CTZ × GBP interaction is not influenced by the transporters in the kidney.",1,B
33,29018999,"The objective of this study was to perform population pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis of gabapentin in healthy Korean subjects and to investigate the possible effect of genetic polymorphisms (1236C > T, 2677G > T/A, and 3435C > T) of ABCB1 gene on PK parameters of gabapentin. Data were collected from bioequivalence studies, in which 173 subjects orally received three different doses of gabapentin (300, 400, and 800 mg). Only data from reference formulation were used. Population pharmacokinetics (PKs) of gabapentin was estimated using a nonlinear mixed-effects model (NONMEM). Gabapentin showed considerable inter-individual variability (from 5.2- to 8.7-fold) in PK parameters. Serum concentration of gabapentin was well fitted by a one-compartment model with first-order absorption and lag time. An inhibitory Emax model was applied to describe the effect of dose on bioavailability. The oral clearance was estimated to be 11.1 L/h. The volume of distribution was characterized as 81.0 L. The absorption rate constant was estimated at 0.860 h-1, and the lag time was predicted at 0.311 h. Oral bioavailability was estimated to be 68.8% at dose of 300 mg, 62.7% at dose of 400 mg, and 47.1% at dose of 800 mg. The creatinine clearance significantly influenced on the oral clearance (P < 0.005) and ABCB1 2677G > T/A genotypes significantly influenced on the absorption rate constant (P < 0.05) of gabapentin. However, ABCB1 1236C > T and 3435C > T genotypes showed no significant effect on gabapentin PK parameters. The results of the present study indicate that the oral bioavailability of gabapentin is decreased when its dosage is increased. In addition, ABCB1 2677G > T/A polymorphism can explain the substantial inter-individual variability in the absorption of gabapentin.","The objective of this study is to perform an analysis on how the nerve-related pain medication gabapentin performs in healthy Korean participants and to investigate the possible effect of genetic changes in the drug-resistant ABCB1 gene on how gabapentin is absorbed and distributed in the body. Data are collected from other studies where 173 people received three different doses by mouth (orally) of gabapentin. Only data on the drug design and performance are used. How the body handles and uses gabapentin is measured. Gabapentin shows a lot of variation or differences between people in how it is absorbed, distributed and released from the body. Blood concentration of gabapentin is used to understand the process of distributing and eliminating the medication from the body. How the dose amount impacts availability in the body is measured. The oral clearance is estimated to be 11.1 liters per hour. The volume of distribution was characterized as 81.0 L. How quickly the medication enters the body remains steady. Availability of the drug from the oral dose is estimated to be 68.8% at a dose of 300 mg, 62.7% at a dose of 400 mg, and 47.1% at a dose of 800 mg. Clearing creatinine (a waste product that comes from wear and tear of the muscles) influences the oral clearance, and ABCB1 genes influence how quickly gabapentin is absorbed by the body. However, genes showed no significant effect on gabapentin drug activity parameters. The results of this study suggest that the availability of gabapentin to the body when taken by mouth is decreased when the dosage is increased. In addition, changes in the ABCB1 gene can explain the major differences in how gabapentin is absorbed by the body between people.",1,B

33,15584938,"Purpose: The pharmacokinetics of gabapentin in paediatric patients with uncontrolled seizures was studied. Methods: Thirteen paediatric patients (mean age: 9.4 years) with uncontrolled partial seizures were included. Patients received gabapentin orally until doses were individualized to 9.6-39.8 mg/kg/day. Blood samples were obtained just prior to the dose and over 8 h after gabapentin was administered in the fasting state. The plasma concentration of gabapentin was measured by a high-performance liquid chromatography assay. Pharmacokinetic parameters for gabapentin were determined by non-compartment methods using multivariate regression analysis. Results: Data from nine patients were suitable for pharmacokinetic analysis. The C(max) from 0.9 to 5.8 microg/mL (mean: 2.6 +/- 1.7 microg/mL) and T(max) from 0.5 to 2.0 h (mean: 1.6 +/- 1.0 h). The apparent clearance (Cl/F) ranged from 0.12 to 1.12 L/h/kg (mean: 0.50 +/- 0.29 L/h/kg), and the elimination half-life from 3.2 to 12.2 h (mean: 5.5 +/- 0.8 h). Five patients experienced moderate (n = 4) to severe (n = 1) aggressive behaviour and another gained weight on gabapentin. Conclusions: Our data suggests that gabapentin pharmacokinetics can vary substantially among paediatric patients. Gabapentin was well tolerated in patients with uncontrolled partial seizures up to 6 months of therapy.","How the pediatric or child patients with uncontrolled seizures are able to handle gabapentin (a nerve-related pain medication) and the processes of absorbing, distributing, using, and removing it is studied. In this study, 13 pediatric patients (less the 21 years old) with an average age of about 9 years with uncontrolled partial seizures are included. Patients received gabapentin orally (by mouth) until doses are changed for each patient. Blood samples are obtained just before the dose and over 8 hours after gabapentin is given during fasting, when all foods have been completely digested. Blood concentrations of gabapentin is measured by blood tests. Absorption, distribution, use, and removal of gabapentin in the body is analyzed. Data from 9 patients are able to be used for analysis. The maximum concentration of the drug and the time it takes to reach maximum concentration are estimated. Five patients experience moderate (4 patients) to severe (1 patient) aggressive behavior, and another gained weight on gabapentin. In conclusion, the data in this study suggests that how the body processes gabapentin can vary a lot among pediatric patients. In this study, patients with uncontrolled partial seizures were able to handle gabapentin well up to 6 months of therapy.",1,B
33,10219274,"Purpose: This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of age, age-related changes in renal function, and gender on the single-dose pharmacokinetics of orally administered gabapentin (GBP). Methods: The pharmacokinetics of a single 400-mg oral dose of GBP were studied in 36 healthy subjects (18 men and 18 women) aged 20-78 years. Serial blood samples and total urine output were collected for 48 h after the dose. GBP concentrations in plasma and urine were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography, and pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by noncompartmental methods. Results: All subjects tolerated the drug well, with only mild symptoms reported. No change in maximal GBP plasma concentration (Cmax), time at which Cmax occurred (tmax), or apparent volume of distribution (V/F) with age was noted. A significant linear decline in apparent oral clearance (CL/F), elimination-rate constant (lambda z), and renal clearance (CLR) with increasing age was observed (p < 0.005). Because total urinary recovery of unchanged drug (an estimate of F for GBP) did not change with age, the decline in CL/F and lambda z can be explained by the decline in CLR. The only pharmacokinetic parameter that was significantly different between genders was Cmax, which was approximately 25% higher for women than for men (p = 0.016), consistent with gender differences in body size. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that changes in renal function are responsible for age-related changes in GBP pharmacokinetics. Reduction of GBP dosage may be required in elderly patients with reduced renal function. The pharmacokinetics of GBP are similar in men and women.","This study is conducted to evaluate the effect of age, age-related changes in renal or kidney function, and gender on the single-dose pharmacokinetics (or drug activity) of orally (by mouth) administered gabapentin (GBP).

No change in the highest (peak) gabapentin amount, the time at which the highest gabapentin amount occurred, or apparent volume of distribution (the ability of various drugs to distribute through the body fluids) with age was noted. A major decline in clearance of gabapentin that is taken orally, the rate of removal from the body, and clearing it through the kidneys with increasing age is observed. The decline of oral clearance and rate of removal of gabapentin from the body can be explained by the decline in clearance by the kidneys. The only measure that is very different between genders is the highest (peak) gabapentin amount, which is approximately 25% higher for women than for men, consistent with gender differences in body size. In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that changes in kidney function are responsible for age-related changes in how the body processes gabapentin. Giving a lesser dose of gabapentin may be required in elderly patients who have weaker kidney functions. How the body processes gabapentin is similar in men and women.",1,B

33,8784216,"The amino acid antiepileptic drug (AED) gabapentin (GBP) is indicated for adjunctive use in the treatment of partial seizures with or without becoming secondarily generalized in individuals older than 12 years. GBP was about as potent as phenytoin in the maximal electroshock test, but had a different profile of efficacy than standard antiepileptics in a range of animal models. Possible mechanisms of action include biochemical effects enhancing the ratio of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) to glutamate, ion-channel actions (direct or indirect), and/ or enhancement of nonsynaptic GABA release. The anticonvulsant effect appears to depend on concentration of gabapentin in neurons, presumably by the L-system amino acid transporter that has been implicated in absorption from the gut. Data from studies for U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval suggested a direct relationship of clinical response to dose and efficacy did not plateau at the doses used. The maximally effective dose, relationship of efficacy to blood level, and maximum tolerable dose are not yet known conclusively. Lack of significant binding to plasma proteins and lack of liver metabolism contribute to the absence of known limiting drug-drug interactions, particularly with other AEDs. Excretion intact in the urine affords dose adjustment on the basis of creatinine clearance. A half-life of approximately 7 h necessitates multiple doses daily for many individuals. The medication is well tolerated, in general. Side effects tend to be mild to moderate in intensity, most frequently affect the central nervous system, and resolve with time in many individuals. GBP has been prescribed for approximately 70,000 individuals worldwide without untoward incidence of severe systemic toxicity to date. Safety data continue to accumulate. GBP has been labeled category C on the basis of effects on rodent fetuses. Experience with use in pregnant women is limited and human teratogenic effects have not been reported. Data from ongoing monotherapy trials will help to clarify the range of clinical utility of gabapentin.","The drug gabapentin (GBP) is an addition to the regular treatment of partial seizures with or without becoming generalized seizures in the entire brain in people older than 12 years. Gabapentin has performed differently than other standard drugs that are used to prevent seizures in a number of animal experiments. Possible processes that lead the drug to have an effect include the response of increasing the development of neurotransmitters (signaling molecules in the brain) and other cell functions. The act of stopping or slowing the excessive rapid firing of neurons (brain cells) during seizures seems to depend on the concentration of gabapentin in neurons. Data from studies for U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval suggest a direct relationship of medical response to the dose and success did not level-off at the doses used. The maximally effective dose (the dose at which any higher dose would not lead to improvement), the relationship of its performance to blood level, and the maximum tolerable dose (the highest dose most people can handle) are not completely known. Lack of attachment to plasma (or blood) proteins and lack of liver energy contribute to the absence of known interactions between drugs, particularly with other drugs that are used to prevent seizures. Doses can be adjusted based on the amount of the drug found in the urine. The time it takes for the concentration of the gabapentin in the plasma or in the body to be reduced by half is about 7 hours, requiring multiple doses daily for many people. In general, people are able to handle the medication and its side effects. Side effects tend to be mild to moderate in intensity, most frequently affect the central nervous system (spinal cord and brain), and resolve with time in many individuals.

Although the mechanism of action of gabapentin is not fully established, there is strong evidence to suggest a novel mechanism of action. Gabapentin is a unique and promising drug that could improve the quality of life of patients with epilepsy and is a welcome addition to the armamentarium of currently available AEDs for the treatment of patients with seizures of partial onset.","Gabapentin is a new antiseizure or antiepileptic drug (AED) with attractive drug activity. Gabapentin is absorbed by an active transport system. The drug has a large distribution. Gabapentin is not bound to blood proteins, does not activate liver enzymes and is not broken down. Normally, half of the drug is eliminated in 6-8 hours. It is cleared unchanged by the kidney with a blood clearance similar to standard kidney substance clearance. The drug does not have major drug-drug interactions when used with other AEDs or swallowed birth control drugs. Gabapentin used as an add-on AED greatly reduces the amount of partial seizures and partial seizures developing into standard serizures in three clinical trials. The drug is well tolerated, with temporary drowsiness and dizziness as the most common side effects. Although how gabapentin works is unknown, there is evidence for a new mechanism of its biological action. Gabapentin is a unique and promising drug that could improve life for patients with epilepsy (a brain disorder causing seizures). The drug is a welcome addition to current AEDs for treating patients with seizures of partial onset.",2,B
35,22256806,"BACKGROUND: Although bone mineral density (BMD) testing to screen for osteoporosis (BMD T score, −2.50 or lower) is recommended for women 65 years of age or older, there are few data to guide decisions about the interval between BMD tests. METHODS: We studied 4957 women, 67 years of age or older, with normal BMD (T score at the femoral neck and total hip, −1.00 or higher) or osteopenia (T score, −1.01 to −2.49) and with no history of hip or clinical vertebral fracture or of treatment for osteoporosis, followed prospectively for up to 15 years. The BMD testing interval was defined as the estimated time for 10% of women to make the transition to osteoporosis before having a hip or clinical vertebral fracture, with adjustment for estrogen use and clinical risk factors. Transitions from normal BMD and from three subgroups of osteopenia (mild, moderate, and advanced) were analyzed with the use of parametric cumulative incidence models. Incident hip and clinical vertebral fractures and initiation of treatment with bisphosphonates, calcitonin, or raloxifene were treated as competing risks. RESULTS: The estimated BMD testing interval was 16.8 years (95% confidence interval [CI], 11.5 to 24.6) for women with normal BMD, 17.3 years (95% CI, 13.9 to 21.5) for women with mild osteopenia, 4.7 years (95% CI, 4.2 to 5.2) for women with moderate osteopenia, and 1.1 years (95% CI, 1.0 to 1.3) for women with advanced osteopenia. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that osteoporosis would develop in less than 10% of older, post-menopausal women during rescreening intervals of approximately 15 years for women with normal bone density or mild osteopenia, 5 years for women with moderate osteopenia, and 1 year for women with advanced osteopenia.","Although bone mineral density (BMD) testing to measure how much calcium and other minerals are in bones to look for osteoporosis (a condition in which bones become weak and brittle) is suggested for women 65 years old or older, few studies look at how long to wait between tests. We studied 4957 women, 67 years old and older, with normal BMD or weaker than normal bones who had never broken a hip or spine or received treatment for osteoporosis, followed for up to 15 years. The time between BMD testing was the estimated time for 10% of women to develop osteoporosis before breaking a hip or spine, considering estrogen (female-specific hormone) use and risk factors. We used mathematical models to look at changes from normal BMD and from mild, moderate, and advanced osteopenia. We considered hip and spine breaks and people taking drugs to strengthen bones. We found the estimated time between BMD testing was 16.8 years for women with normal BMD and 17.3, 4.7. and 1.1 years for women with mild, moderate, and advanced osteopenia, respectively. Our results suggest that less than 10% of older women who had gone through menopause (a point in time 12 months after the last period) would develop osteoporosis if tested about every 15 years for women with normal BMD or mild osteopenia, 5 years for women with moderate osteopenia, and 1 year for women with advanced osteopenia.",1,C

35,29946735,"Importance: By 2020, approximately 12.3 million individuals in the United States older than 50 years are expected to have osteoporosis. Osteoporotic fractures, particularly hip fractures, are associated with limitations in ambulation, chronic pain and disability, loss of independence, and decreased quality of life, and 21% to 30% of patients who experience a hip fracture die within 1 year. The prevalence of primary osteoporosis (ie, osteoporosis without underlying disease) increases with age and differs by race/ethnicity. With the aging of the US population, the potential preventable burden is likely to increase in future years. Objective: To update the 2011 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on screening for osteoporosis. Evidence review: The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on screening for and treatment of osteoporotic fractures in men and women, as well as risk assessment tools, screening intervals, and efficacy of screening and treatment in subgroups. The screening population was postmenopausal women and older men with no known previous osteoporotic fractures and no known comorbid conditions or medication use associated with secondary osteoporosis. Findings: The USPSTF found convincing evidence that bone measurement tests are accurate for detecting osteoporosis and predicting osteoporotic fractures in women and men. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that clinical risk assessment tools are moderately accurate in identifying risk of osteoporosis and osteoporotic fractures. The USPSTF found convincing evidence that drug therapies reduce subsequent fracture rates in postmenopausal women. The USPSTF found that the evidence is inadequate to assess the effectiveness of drug therapies in reducing subsequent fracture rates in men without previous fractures. Conclusions and recommendation: The USPSTF recommends screening for osteoporosis with bone measurement testing to prevent osteoporotic fractures in women 65 years and older. (B recommendation) The USPSTF recommends screening for osteoporosis with bone measurement testing to prevent osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal women younger than 65 years at increased risk of osteoporosis, as determined by a formal clinical risk assessment tool. (B recommendation) The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for osteoporosis to prevent osteoporotic fractures in men. (I statement).","By 2020, about 12.3 million people in the United States older than 50 years are expected to have osteoporosis, a condition in which bones become weak and brittle. Broken bones from osteoporosis, especially hip breaks, are related to a limited ability to walk, long-term pain and disability, loss of independence, and reduced quality of life. 21% to 30% of people who break a hip die within 1 year. The number of people during a specific period with primary osteoporosis (i.e., osteoporosis not resulting from other disease), goes up with age and changes depending on race/ethnicity. With the U.S. population getting older, the possible cost of preventable disease is expected to go up in the future. We aim to update a 2011 expert panel suggestion on checking for osteoporosis. The expert panel looked at scientific studies on checking for and treatment of bone breaks due to osteoporosis in men and women, and tools to measure risk, periods between checks, and how well checks and treatment work in smaller groups. The group that was checked for osteoporosis was women who had gone through menopause (a point in time 12 months after the last period) and older men who had never had a known bone break due to osteoporosis and no known conditions or drug use known to cause osteoporosis. The expert panel found strong proof that bone measurement tests are correct for finding osteoporosis and predicting bone breaks due to osteoporosis in women and men. The expert panel found some proof that tools to measure risk are somewhat correct in finding risk of osteoporosis and bone breaks due to osteoporosis. The expert panel found strong proof that drugs decrease later bone break rates in women who have gone through menopause. The expert panel found there is not enough proof to measure how well drugs work to decrease later bone break rates in men without previous bone breaks. The expert panel suggests checking for osteoporosis with bone measurement testing to prevent bone breaks from osteoporosis in women 65 years and older. The expert panel suggests checking for osteoporosis with bone measurement testing to prevent bone breaks from osteoporosis in women younger than 65 years who have gone through menopause who have a greater risk of osteoporosis, as decided by a tool used by doctors to measure risk. The expert panel concludes there is not enough data to measure the pros versus cons of checking for osteoporosis to prevent bone breaks from osteoporosis in men. ",1,C
35,28634907,"Background: Existing guidelines for repeat screening and treatment monitoring intervals regarding the use of dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans are conflicting or lacking. The Choosing Wisely campaign recommends against repeating DXA scans within 2 years of initial screening. It is unclear how frequently physicians order repeat scans and what clinical factors contribute to their use. Objective: To estimate cumulative incidence and predictors of repeat DXA for screening or treatment monitoring in a regional health system. Design: Retrospective longitudinal cohort study PARTICIPANTS: A total of 5992 women aged 40-84 years who received initial DXA screening from 2006 to 2011 within a regional health system in Sacramento, CA. Main measures: Two- and five-year cumulative incidence and hazard rations (HR) of repeat DXA by initial screening result (classified into three groups: low or high risk of progression to osteoporosis, or osteoporosis) and whether women were prescribed osteoporosis drugs after initial DXA. Key results: Among women not treated after initial DXA, 2-year cumulative incidence for low-risk, high-risk, and osteoporotic women was 8.0%, 13.8%, and 19.6%, respectively, increasing to 42.9%, 60.4%, and 57.4% by 5 years after initial screening. For treated women, median time to repeat DXA was over 3 years for all groups. Relative to women with low-risk initial DXA, high-risk initial DXA significantly predicted repeat screening for untreated women [adjusted HR 1.67 (95% CI 1.40-2.00)] but not within the treated group [HR 1.09 (95% CI 0.91-1.30)]. Conclusions: Repeat DXA screening was common in women both at low and high risk of progression to osteoporosis, with a substantial proportion of women receiving repeat scans within 2 years of initial screening. Conversely, only 60% of those at high-risk of progression to osteoporosis were re-screened within 5 years. Interventions are needed to help clinicians make higher-value decisions regarding repeat use of DXA scans.","Current guidelines disagree or do not exist for how long to wait between checks and treatment check-ins involving the use of dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans, a technique used by doctors to measure a patient's risk of osteoporosis (a condition in which bones become weak and brittle). A campaign to avoid unnecessary medical tests, treatments and procedures does not suggest DXA scans within 2 years of the first test. How often and for which patient characteristics doctors order repeat scans is unclear. We aim to estimate the number of people at risk who develop osteoporosis over a period and predictors of repeat DXA for checks and treatment check-ins in a healthcare facility. We studied 5992 women aged 40-84 years who underwent DXA scans to check for osteoporosis from 2006 to 2011 at a healthcare facility in Sacramento, CA. Main test scores included two- and five-year amounts and risks of repeat DXA by initial test results (classified into three groups: low or high risk of worsening to osteoporosis, or osteoporosis) and whether women were given osteoporosis drugs after the first DXA. For women not treated after a first DXA, 2-year amounts for low-risk, high-risk, and osteoporotic women were 8.0%, 13.8%, and 19.6%, respectively, increasing to 42.9%, 60.4%, and 57.4% by 5 years after the first screening. For treated women, average time to repeat DXA was over 3 years for all groups. Compared to women with low-risk initial DXA, high-risk initial DXA significantly led to repeat screening for untreated women but not within the treated group. Conclusions: Repeat DXA screening was common in women both at low and high risk of worsening to osteoporosis, with a large amount of women receiving repeat scans within 2 years of initial screening. On the other hand, only 60% of those at high-risk of worsening or progression to osteoporosis were re-screened within 5 years.

Results: In 54,280 postmenopausal women aged 50 to 64 years without a bone mineral density test, the time for 10% to develop a treatment-level FRAX score could not be estimated accurately because of rare incidence of treatment-level scores. In 6096 women who had FRAX scores calculated with bone mineral density, the estimated unadjusted time to treatment-level FRAX ranged from 7.6 years (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.6-8.7) for those aged 65 to 69, to 5.1 years (95% CI, 3.5-7.5) for those aged 75 to 79 at baseline.

We measured new occurences of teratment-level and testing-level fracture risk scores in postmenopausal women aged 50 years and older, before receiving drug treatment and the first hip or clinical vertebral fracture. In 54,280 women who had gone through menopause aged 50 to 64 years without a bone mineral density test, we could not estimate the time for 10% to need treatment based on a common osteoporosis questionnaire due to too few scores suggesting treatment.

35,26458388,"We investigated the value of routine laboratory testing for identifying underlying causes in older men diagnosed with osteoporosis. Most osteoporotic and nonosteoporotic men had ≥1 laboratory abnormality. Few individual laboratory abnormalities were more common in osteoporotic men. The benefit of routine laboratory testing in older osteoporotic men may be low. Introduction: To evaluate the utility of recommended laboratory testing to identify secondary causes in older men with osteoporosis, we examined prevalence of laboratory abnormalities in older men with and without osteoporosis. Methods: One thousand five hundred seventy-two men aged ≥65 years in the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men study completed bone mineral density (BMD) testing and a battery of laboratory measures, including serum calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, parathyroid hormone (PTH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), 25-OH vitamin D, total testosterone, spot urine calcium/creatinine ratio, spot urine albumin/creatinine ratio, creatinine-derived estimated glomerular filtration rate, 24-h urine calcium, and 24-h urine free cortisol. Using cross-sectional analyses, we calculated prevalence ratios (PRs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) for the association of any and specific laboratory abnormalities with osteoporosis and the number of men with osteoporosis needed to test to identify one additional laboratory abnormality compared to testing men without osteoporosis. Results: Approximately 60 % of men had ≥1 laboratory abnormality in both men with and without osteoporosis. Among individual tests, only vitamin D insufficiency (PR, 1.13; 95 % CI, 1.05-1.22) and high alkaline phosphatase (PR, 3.05; 95 % CI, 1.52-6.11) were more likely in men with osteoporosis. Hypercortisolism and hyperthyroidism were uncommon and not significantly more frequent in men with osteoporosis. No osteoporotic men had hypercalciuria. Conclusions: Though most of these older men had ≥1 laboratory abnormality, few routinely recommended individual tests were more common in men with osteoporosis than in those without osteoporosis. Possibly excepting vitamin D and alkaline phosphatase, benefit of routine laboratory testing to identify possible secondary causes in older osteoporotic men appears low. Results may not be generalizable to younger men or to older men in whom history and exam findings raise clinical suspicion for a secondary cause of osteoporosis.","We looked at how helpful routine lab testing is for finding underlying causes in older men diagnosed with osteoporosis (a condition in which bones become weak and brittle). Most men with and without osteoporosis had one or more abnormal lab measurement. Few single lab abnormalities were more common in men with osteoporosis. Routine lab testing in older men with osteoporosis may not be helpful. We aim to rate how useful recommended lab testing is to find underlying causes of osteoporosis in older men by looking at the number of older men with lab abnormalities with and without osteoporosis during a specific period. We studied 1,572 men 65 years old and older who has bone mineral density (BMD) testing and many other lab measurements. We checked for links of any lab abnormalities with osteoporosis and the number of men with osteoporosis needed to test to find one more lab abnormality compared to testing men without osteoporosis. We found that about 60% of men with and without osteoporosis had one or more lab abnormality. Among lab tests, only not enough vitamin D and high alkaline phosphatase (suggesting damage to liver or bone disorder) were more likely in men with osteoporosis. Too much cortisol (stress hormone) and overactive thyroid (metabolism-regulating hormone) were rare and not meaningfully more common in men with osteoporosis. No men with osteoporosis had high levels of calcium in the urine. Though most of these older men had one or more lab abnormality, few often-recommended tests were more common in men with osteoporosis than in those without. Except for possibly vitamin D and alkaline phosphatase, usefulness of routine lab testing to find possible underlying causes in older men with osteoporosis seems low. Results may not apply to younger men or to older men thought to have osteoporosis from underlying causes.",1,C

Although guidelines are lacking for rescreening women who have normal bone mineral density on initial screening, intervals of at least four years appear safe. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force found insufficient evidence to recommend screening for osteoporosis in men; other organizations recommend screening all men 70 years and older. In patients with newly diagnosed osteoporosis, suggested laboratory tests to identify secondary causes include serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, calcium, creatinine, and thyroid-stimulating hormone. First-line treatment to prevent fractures consists of fall prevention, smoking cessation, moderation of alcohol intake, and bisphosphonate therapy. Clinicians should consider discontinuing bisphosphonate therapy after five years in women without a personal history of vertebral fractures. Raloxifene, teriparatide, and denosumab are alternative effective treatments for certain subsets of patients and for those who are unable to take or whose condition does not respond to bisphosphonates. The need for follow-up bone mineral density testing in patients receiving treatment for osteoporosis is uncertain.","Bone breaks due to osteoporosis (a condition in which bones become weak and brittle) happen in about 50% of white women and 20% of white men in their lifetime.

The expert panel did not find enough proof to recommend checking for osteoporosis in men; other groups recommend checking all men 70 years and older. In people with newly found osteoporosis, lab tests to find underlying causes include measuring blood levels of different substances. The best treatment to prevent breaks includes preventing falls, stopping smoking, reducing alcohol consumption, and a group of drugs that help prevent or slow down bone thinning. Doctors should think about stopping a group of drugs that help prevent or slow down bone thinning after five years in women without a history of spine breaks. Other types of drugs for osteoporosis exist for certain groups of patients and for those who are unable to take or whose condition is not helped by one group of drugs that help prevent or slow down bone thinning.

The AUC for OSTAi and NOF 2013 were 0.739 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.728-0.749, P<0.001) and 0.618 (95% CI, 0.606-0.630, P<0.001), respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of OSTAi, at the selected cutoff value of -1, and NOF 2013 to identify osteoporosis were 73.1%, 62.0% and 78.3%, 45.7%, respectively. Conclusions: As OSTA for Asian populations, OSTAi is an useful tool to identify Taiwan postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, In comparison with NOF 2013, OSTAi may be an easier and better tool for referral to BMD measurement by DXA in this area.","The study aims to create an osteoporosis (or bone weakening) self assessment (OSTAi) tool and compare it with the National Osteoporosis Foundation 2013 recommendations (NOF 2013) or bone mineral density (BMD) or hardness testing among Taiwan postmenopausal women who completed their final menstrual or sexual cycle. Taiwan Osteoporosis Associated (TOA) had a nationwide BMD survey by a bus installed with an X-ray machine between 2008 and 2011. All participants completed a questionnaire, which had socioeconomic and risk factors of osteoporotic fracture in fracture risk tool.  12,175 Taiwan postmenopausal women participated in this survey. There are 6393 (52.5%) participants below the cutoff and whose risk of osteoporosis was 57.5% (3647/6393). The measurements for OSTAi and NOF were noteworthy. The sensitivity (accuracy of detecting people with the disease) and specificity (accuracy of detecting people without the disease) of OSTAi at the cutoff and NOF 2013 to detect osteoporosis were 73.1%, 62.0% and 78.3%, 45.7%, respectively. Known as OSTA for Asian populations, OSTAi is useful to identify Taiwan postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.

35,24809808,"We evaluated the prevalence and geographic variation of short-interval (repeated in under 2 years) dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry tests (DXAs) among Medicare beneficiaries. Short-interval DXA use varied across regions (coefficient of variation = 0.64), and unlike other DXAs, rates decreased with payment cuts. Introduction: The American College of Rheumatology, through the Choosing Wisely initiative, identified measuring bone density more often than every 2 years as care ""physicians and patients should question."" We measured the prevalence and described the geographic variation of short-interval (repeated in under 2 years) DXAs among Medicare beneficiaries and estimated the cost of this testing and its responsiveness to payment change. Methods: Using 100 % Medicare claims data, 2006-2011, we identified DXAs and short-interval DXAs for female Medicare beneficiaries over age 66. We determined the population rate of DXAs and short-interval DXAs, as well as Medicare spending on short-interval DXAs, nationally and by hospital referral region (HRR). Results: DXA use was stable 2008-2011 (12.4 to 11.5 DXAs per 100 women). DXA use varied across HRRs: in 2011, overall DXA use ranged from 6.3 to 23.0 per 100 women (coefficient of variation = 0.18), and short-interval DXAs ranged from 0.3 to 8.0 per 100 women (coefficient of variation = 0.64). Short-interval DXA use fluctuated substantially with payment changes; other DXAs did not. Short-interval DXAs, which represented 10.1 % of all DXAs, cost Medicare approximately US$16 million in 2011. Conclusions: One out of ten DXAs was administered in a time frame shorter than recommended and at a substantial cost to Medicare. DXA use varied across regions. Short-interval DXA use was responsive to reimbursement changes, suggesting carefully designed policy and payment reform may reduce this care identified by rheumatologists as low value.","We rated the number and variation (or differences) across the country of dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry tests (DXAs - useful tests for measuring bone density) repeated in under 2 years (short-interval) in people on Medicare during a specific period. Use of short-interval DXAs varied across the country and unlike other DXAs, use went down with Medicare payment cuts. A campaign to avoid unnecessary medical tests, treatments and procedures found measuring bone density more often than every 2 years as care ""physicians and patients should question."" We rated the number and variation across the country of short-interval DXAs in people on Medicare during a specific period and estimated the testing cost and how much is changed based on payment. We used only information from Medicare claims in 2006-2011 to find DXAs and short-term DXAs for females over age 66 on Medicare. We found out how many DXAs and short-term DXAs were done, and how many Medicare dollars were spent on short-interval DXAs, across the country and by healthcare markets. From 2008-2011, DXA use was steady (12.4 to 11.5 DXAs per 100 women). DXA use varied across healthcare markets. Short-interval DXA use changed a lot based on payment; other DXAs did not. In 2011, Medicare spent about $16 million USD on short-interval DXAs, which made up 10.1% of all DXAs. We conclude that one out of 10 DXAs was done sooner than recommended, costing Medicare considerably. DXA use varied across the country. Short-interval DXA use changed based on payment, suggesting policy and payment changes may decrease this low-value care.",1,C
35,15549501,"Osteoporosis and its consequent increase in fracture risk is a major health concern for postmenopausal women and older men and has the potential to reach epidemic proportions. The ""gold standard"" for osteoporosis diagnosis is bone densitometry. However, economic issues or availability of the technology may prevent the possibility of mass screening. The goal of this study was to develop and validate a clinical scoring index designed as a prescreening tool to help clinicians identify which women are at increased risk of osteoporosis [bone mineral density (BMD) T-score -2.5 or less] and should therefore undergo further testing with bone densitometry. Records were analyzed for 1522 postmenopausal females over 50 years of age who had undergone testing with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Osteoporosis risk index scores were compared to bone density T-scores. Hologic QDR 4500 technology was used to measure BMD at the femoral neck and lumbar spine (L1-L4). Participants who had a previous diagnosis of osteoporosis or were taking bone-active medication were excluded. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to identify the specific cutpoint value that would identify women at increased risk of low BMD. A simple algorithm based on age, weight, history of previous low impact fracture, early menopause, and corticosteroid therapy was developed. Validation of this five-item osteoporosis prescreening risk assessment (OPERA) index showed that the tool, at the recommended threshold (or cutoff value) of two, had a sensitivity that ranged from 88.1 [95% confidence interval (CI) for the mean: 86.2-91.9%] at the femoral neck to 90% (95% CI for the mean: 86.1-93.1%) at the lumbar spine area. Corresponding specificity values were 60.6 (95% CI for the mean: 57.9-63.3%) and 64.2% (95% CI for the mean: 61.4-66.9%), respectively. The positive predictive value (PPV) ranged from 29 at the femoral neck to 39.2% at the lumbar spine, while the corresponding negative predictive values (NPVs) reached 96.5 and 96.2%, respectively. Based on this cutoff value, the area under the ROC curve was 0.866 (95% CI for the mean: 0.847-0.882) for the lumbar spine and 0.814 (95% CI for the mean: 0.793-0.833) for the femoral neck. We conclude that the OPERA is a free and effective method for identifying Italian postmenopausal women at increased risk of osteoporosis. Its use could facilitate the appropriate and more cost-effective use of bone densitometry in developing countries.","Osteoporosis, a condition in which bones become weak and brittle, and the increase in the risk of bone breaks it causes has worried women who have gone through menopause (a point in time 12 months after the last period) and older men and could become a huge problem. The best way to diagnose osteoporosis is bone densitometry, a common test to measure bone density. Large-scale checks may not be possible due to economic issues or availability of densitometry. We aimed to make and test a scoring system to help doctors find which women are more likely to develop osteoporosis and should have more testing with bone densitometry. We looked at records for 1522 women who have gone through menopause over 50 years old who had dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA - a common test for bone density). We compared risk scores to bone density tests. We measured BMD at the hip and lower spine. We excluded people who were previously diagnosed with osteoporosis or were taking drugs affecting bones. We came up with a simple calculation based on age, weight, history of previous falls from a standing height or lower, early menopause, and use of a certain kind of steroid. Testing of this five-item osteoporosis prescreening risk assessment (OPERA) shows high accuracy for osteoporosis detection. OPERA shows high accuracy for no detection. The accuracy for results detecting osteoporosis ranged from 29 at the femoral neck to 39.2% at the lumbar spine, while the corresponding accuracy for results not detecting osteoporosis reached 96.5 and 96.2%, respectively. We conclude that the OPERA is a free and effective way to identify Italian women who have gone through menopause at higher risk of osteoporosis. Use of OPERA could help the appropriate and more cost-effective use of bone densitometry in developing countries.",1,C
37,30335626,"Background: Pregabalin has shown opioid sparing and analgesic effects in the early postoperative period; however, perioperative effects on cognition have not been studied. A randomized, parallel group, placebo-controlled investigation in 80 donor nephrectomy patients was previously performed that evaluated the analgesic, opioid-sparing, and antihyperalgesic effects of pregabalin. This article describes a secondary exploratory analysis that tested the hypothesis that pregabalin would impair cognitive function compared to placebo. Methods: Eighty patients scheduled for donor nephrectomy participated in this randomized, placebo-controlled study. Pregabalin (150 mg twice daily, n = 40) or placebo (n = 40) was administered on the day of surgery and the first postoperative day, in addition to a pain regimen consisting of opioids, steroids, local anesthetics, and acetaminophen. Specific cognitive tests measuring inhibition, sustained attention, psychomotor speed, visual memory, and strategy were performed at baseline, 24 h, and 3 to 5 days after surgery, using tests from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery. Results: In the spatial working memory within errors test, the number of errors increased with pregabalin compared to placebo 24 h after surgery; median (25th, 75th percentile) values were 1 (0, 6) versus 0 (0, 1; rate ratio [95% CI], 3.20 [1.55 to 6.62]; P = 0.002). Furthermore, pregabalin significantly increased the number of errors in the stop-signal task stop-go test compared with placebo; median (25th, 75th percentile) values were 3 (1, 6) versus 1 (0, 2; rate ratio, 2.14 [1.13 to 4.07]; P = 0.020). There were no significant differences between groups in the paired associated learning, reaction time, rapid visual processing, or spatial working memory strategy tests. Conclusions: Perioperative pregabalin significantly negatively affected subdomains of executive functioning, including inhibition, and working memory compared to placebo, whereas psychomotor speed was not changed.","Pregabalin is a nerve pain medication. The drug has been shown to help reduce opioid use (opioid-sparing) and have pain relieving (analgesic) effects in the early period following a surgery. However, effects before, during, and after surgery on cognition (thinking ability) have not been studied. A study in 80 patients that had one or both of their kidneys removed was previously conducted to evaluate the opioid-sparing, analgesic, and antihyperalgesic (reduction of pain sensitivity) effects of pregabalin. This paper describes a secondary investigation that tested if pregabalin would impair cognitive function when compared to a control (no treatment) group. Eighty patients scheduled for donor nephrectomy (removal of one or both kidneys) participated in this study. Pregabalin (150 mg twice daily) or placebo (a harmless pill) was administered (given) on the day of surgery and the first post-operation day. This was given in addition to a pain regimen consisting of opioids, steroids, local anesthetics, and acetaminophen (pain medication). Cognitive tests measuring inhibition (restraint), sustained attention, psychomotor (movement) speed, visual memory, and strategy were performed before, 24 h, and 3 to 5 days after surgery. The spatial working memory test is used to determine if a participant can recall the configuration of a series of images. During the test, the number of errors increased with pregabalin treatment compared to placebo 24 h after surgery. Furthermore, pregabalin significantly increased the number of errors in the stop-signal task stop-go test compared with placebo. There were no significant differences between treatment groups in the paired associated learning, reaction time, rapid visual processing, or spatial working memory strategy tests. Perioperative (around surgery time) pregabalin significantly negatively affected several aspects of cognitive function when compared to placebo. However, psychomotor speed or movement was not changed.",1,C

Emerging evidence suggests that pregabalin (PGB) might be a safe and efficacious treatment of long-term BDZ use. The aim of the present study was to investigate the changes in several core cognitive functions after successful treatment of long-term BDZ use and dependence with PGB. Methods: Fourteen patients with long-term BDZ use (mean duration >15 years) underwent neuropsychological assessment with the mini-mental state examination and four tests from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) battery before the initiation of PGB treatment and at a two months follow-up after the cessation of BDZs. Patients' CANTAB percentile score distributions were compared with normative CANTAB data. Results: Patients improved on cognitive measures of global cognitive functioning, time orientation, psychomotor speed, and visuospatial memory and learning with strong effect sizes. By contrast, they failed to improve on measures of attentional flexibility. Despite their significant improvement, patients' scores on most tests remained still at the lower percentiles of CANTAB normative scores. Conclusions: Although preliminary, our findings suggest that successful treatment of long-term BDZ use with PGB is associated with a substantial, though only partial, recovery of BDZ-compromised neuropsychological functioning, at least at a 2-month follow-up.","Benzodiazepines (BDZ) are drugs that are often used to treat anxiety, muscle spasms, and seixures.

37,33515658,"Pregabalin (PGB) is an analog of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid. The currently available evidence favors the misuse and abuse potential of PGB. However, its neurotoxicity remains unclear. Therefore, this study assessed the toxic effects of chronic pregabalin dependence as well as withdrawal on the cortical neurons of the frontal lobe. This study included eighty adult male albino rats which were divided into three groups. Group I (Control) included 40 rats and was further subdivided into two equal subgroups (IA and IB) as negative and positive controls. Group II (PGB-dependent) included 20 rats which received PGB starting with the therapeutic dose (300 mg/day), then the doses were gradually increased until they reached the dependent dose (3400 mg/day) by the end of the first month. Further, the dependent dose was given daily for another 2 months. Group III (PGB withdrawal) included 20 rats which received PGB as described in group II. After that, administration of PGB was stopped and the rats were kept for another one month. By the end of the experiment, all animals were sacrificed by cervical decapitation. The specimens were taken from the frontal cortex for histologic and immunohistochemical staining as well as morphometric analysis. Sections of the frontal cortex of group II showed changes in the form of disturbed architectural pattern of cortical layers, apoptotic cells, weak immunoexpression of Bcl-2 and VEGF as well as moderate-strong immunoexpression of iNOS and nestin. These expressions were significantly different from the control groups, but they were non-significant in comparison with group III. These findings indicate that chronic PGB dependence induces neurotoxic effects mainly in the form of neuronal apoptosis, gliosis, and oxidative stress injury of the frontal cortex. The PGB- induced neurotoxic effects persisted after withdrawal. The influence of these neurotoxic effects and their relevance to the cognitive or neurologic disorders in PGB-dependent individuals warrants further research. Furthermore, it is recommended to quantify the behavioral changes related to PGB dependence as well as withdrawal in future studies.","Pregabalin (PGB) - a nerve pain medication - is an analog of the inhibitory (silencing) neurotransmitter, (chemical messenger in the brain) gamma-aminobutyric acid.

However, its neurotoxicity (poison to the brain) remains unclear. The aim of this study was to assess (measure) the toxic effects of long term dependence on pregabalin. Additionally, the study aimed to assess how withdrawal from (removal of) PGB affects cortical neurons (brain cells) in the front lobe of the brain. This study included eighty adult male albino rats which were divided into three groups. Group I (Control) included 40 rats and was further subdivided into two equal subgroups (IA and IB) as negative and positive controls - groups to compare the treatment group to. Group II (PGB-dependent) included 20 rats. Each rat received PGB starting with the therapeutic (beneficial) dose (300 mg/day). The doses were gradually increased until they reached the dependent (full) dose (3400 mg/day) by the end of the first month. Further, the dependent dose was given daily for another 2 months.

The current study evaluated the brain neurotransmitters; dopamine, glutamate, and norepinephrine. The study also assessed the expression of the apoptosis-related markers Bax, Bcl2, and caspase 3. Western-blotted analysis of the three major mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), the c-JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK), the p38 MAPK, and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), has also been performed. The study also evaluated oxidative stress via assessment of the cortical tissue levels of reduced glutathione and malondialdehyde and the activity of superoxide dismutase. Histopathological examination and histomorphometric evaluation of the darkly degenerated cortical neurons have also been performed. Pregabalin in high doses (150 mg/kg/day and 300 mg/kg/day) disrupted the ERK/JNK/p38-MAPK signaling, reversed the bax/bcl2 ratio, and induced oxidative stress. It also diminished the release of dopamine, glutamate, and norepinephrine and increased the count of degenerated neurons. Alpha tocopherol treatment significantly attenuated the deleterious effects induced by pregabalin. The role of alpha tocopherol in ameliorating the oxidative stress injury, and apoptosis induced by pregabalin, along with its role in normalizing neurotransmitters, modulating the ERK/JNK/p38-MAPK signaling pathways and improving the histopathological cortical changes, offers alpha tocopherol as a promising adjunctive therapy in patients undergoing prolonged pregabalin therapy as those suffering from prolonged seizures and neuropathies.","Pregabalin, a drug often used to treat nerve damage, abuse has become an emerging concern. The current study aimed to investigate nervous system (brain and spinal cord) damage caused by prolonged high-dose of pregabalin. This dose is similar to that used by addicts. Additionally, the study aimed to evaluate the effect of alpha tocopherol, a type of Vitamin E, as a possible agent to help side effects. The study evaluated the brain neurotransmitters; dopamine, glutamate, and norepinephrine. Neurotransmitters are chemical messengers in the body. The study also assessed (measured) the expression of the cell death-related markers Bax, Bcl2, and caspase 3. Additional tests evaluating three mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) was completed. MAPKs are involved in biological pathways that direct cell response to mitogens, or things that induce cell division. The study also evaluated oxidative stress which is an imbalance between production and accumulation of harmful oxygen reactive species. Evaluations of the degenerated cortical neurons, nerve cells within the brain, were also preformed. Pregabalin in high doses (150 mg/kg/day and 300 mg/kg/day) disrupted the signaling for cellular processes, reversed ratios of proteins needed for cell cycles, and induced oxidative stress. It also diminished the release of neurotransmitters and increased the count of degenerated neurons. Alpha tocopherol treatment significantly reduced the harmful effects induced by pregabalin. Alpha tocopherol plays a role in reducing negative side effects induced by pregabalin. It also normalizes neurotransmitter levels, positively effects signaling pathways for cell function, and improves cortical (brain) structure changes. These reasons make alpha tocopherol a promising therapeutic option in patients undergoing prolonged pregabalin therapy.",1,C
37,20194915,"Background: Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) can be associated with neurotoxic side effects including cognitive dysfunction, a problem of considerable importance given the usual long-term course of treatment. Pregabalin is a relatively new AED widely used for the treatment of seizures and some types of chronic pain including fibromyalgia. We measured the cognitive effects of 12 weeks of pregabalin in healthy volunteers. Methods: Thirty-two healthy volunteers were randomized in a double-blind parallel study to receive pregabalin or placebo (1:1). Pregabalin was titrated over 8 weeks to 600 mg/d. At baseline, and after 12 weeks of treatment, all subjects underwent cognitive testing. Test-retest changes in all cognitive and subjective measures were Z scored against test-retest regressions previously developed from 90 healthy volunteers. Z scores from the placebo and pregabalin groups were compared using Wilcoxon tests. Results: Thirty subjects completed the study (94%). Three of 6 target cognitive measures (Digit Symbol, Stroop, Controlled Oral Word Association) revealed significant test-retest differences between the pregabalin and placebo groups, all showing negative effects with pregabalin (p < 0.05). These cognitive effects were paralleled by complaints on the Portland Neurotoxicity Scale, a subjective measure of neurotoxicity (p < 0.01). Conclusion: At conventional doses and titration, pregabalin induced mild negative cognitive effects and neurotoxicity complaints in healthy volunteers. These effects are one factor to be considered in the selection and monitoring of chronic AED therapy. Class of Evidence: This study provides Class I evidence that pregabalin 300 mg BID negatively impacts cognition on some tasks in healthy volunteers.","Antiepileptic - or antiseizure - drugs (AEDs) can be associated with neurotoxic (brain damaging) side effects including cognitive dysfunction.

38,34125728,"Mask wearing is now ubiquitous because of the COVID-19 pandemic and has given rise to medical device-related pressure injuries in persons at risk of skin breakdown. The ear has unique anatomy that is particularly susceptible to injury from pressure. In this time of mandatory personal protective equipment requirements in healthcare facilities, protection and assessment of skin in the vulnerable postauricular area are needed. This article presents a case report of a pressure injury on the ear, reviews the anatomy of the ear, and provides strategies for assessment and treatment of pressure injuries in this often overlooked anatomic region. Treating Mask-Related Pressure Injury: Begin by removing the offending device. If the patient continues to require a mask, provide a mask or “ear saver” mask strap that secures around the head or back of the neck rather than the ear, although again, this does not remove the need for continued skin assessment to areas subjected to pressure and friction. Infection should be considered and ruled out. Local cellulitis is characterized by warmth, redness, pain, and swelling. Presence of purulent discharge might indicate deeper infection and/or abscess. If infection is present, treatment should be initiated with topical and/or systemic antibiotics, depending on culture and severity. Removing hair in the area may be helpful, because it eliminates foreign body intrusion into the wound base, as well as a source of contamination, consistent with the principles of wound bed preparation. It is important to note that a healed wound may not have the same physical strength as normal tissue and may be prone to recurrence, also known as recidivism.","Mark wearing is now present everywhere. This is because of the COVID-19 pandemic (a global, viral, respiratory illness).

Objective: To prepare hydrocolloid films based on crosslinked pectin / starch blend loaded with bioactive extracts from leaves of G. tinctoria and U. molinae with controlled release of bioactive compounds and healing property. Methods: The hydrocolloid films were characterized by FTIR, SEM, and TGA-FTIR techniques and their tensile properties, water uptake, and polyphenolic release profile in aqueous media were evaluated. The dermal anti inflammatory activity of the hydrocolloid films was assessed by the mouse ear inflammation test. The wound healing property of the loaded hydrocolloid films was explored in a rat model and in a clinical trial (sacrum pressure ulcer). Results: The films showed an adequate water-uptake capacity between 100-160%. The release of active compounds from the hydrocolloid films followed the Korsmeyer-Peppas equation. The mechanical properties of hydrocolloid films were not affected by the plant extracts within the concentration range used. The incorporation of the bioactive extracts in the polysaccharide films inhibited the topical edematous response by about 50%. The topical application of the loaded hydrocolloid film on the pressure ulcer is completely closed after 17 days without showing any adverse reaction. Conclusion: A novel hydrocolloid matrix was produced from crosslinked starch-pectin, which exhibited suitable chemical-physical properties to be used as a carrier of plant extracts with wound healing properties.","Pectin-based films are wrapping that is made from pectin, a substance extracted from ripe fruits. Pectin-based films are biodegradable and biocompatible. Additionally, the films are non-toxic, are pH (acid-base) sensitive, and have gelling activity. These qualities make the films of interest in wound dressing. In order to improve how the films responsd to stress and strain, specifically how the material holds up when wet, other biopolymers could be mixed with the pectin-based films. Biopolymers are substances that are found within living organisms, just like pectin is found in fruit. The aim of this study was the prepare hydrocolloid (gel-forming) films using a pectin and starch blend with extracts from two different leaves. The film was made to have a controlled release of bioactive compounds and healing properties. Bioactive compounds are components of food that influence biological or cellular activity within humans or animals that eat them. The hydrocolloid films were tested for their tensile strength (resistance to tension breakage), water uptake, and polyphenolic release profile in wet environments. Polyphenols are compounds with various biological properties, including anti-inflammatory (anti-swelling and -redness from an infection) and antioxidant. The skin anti-inflammatory activity of the hydrocolloid films was assessed (measured) by a test evaluating inflammation on a mouse ear. The wound healing property of the hydrocolloid films was explored in a rat model. The wound healing property was also explored in a human clinical trial looking at lower back pressure ulcers (skin sores). The films showed an adequate water-uptake capacity between 100-160%. The release of active compounds from the hydrocolloid films followed the Korsmeyer-Peppas equation, which implies that release of healing properties was controlled over time. The mechanical properties of the hydrocolloid films, or how they respond to stress, were not affected by the plant extracts. Addition of the same bioactive extracts in a carbohydrate-based film significantly decreased the topical edematous response or the accumulation of watery fluid.

Additional factors associated with pressure ulcer development include cerebrovascular accident, impaired nutritional intake, urinary or fecal incontinence, hypoalbuminemia, and previous fracture. Implementation of preventive measures, such as an in-depth assessment for mobility, a pressure-relieving device combined with adequate repositioning, and thorough evaluation for nutritional status and urinary incontinence, significantly reduce pressure ulcer incidence. If the pressure ulcer is a partial thickness (stage II) wound, the causative factors are probably friction or moisture. If the ulcer is full thickness (stage III and IV), it is secondary to pressure or shearing forces. The development of wound infection is the most common complication in the management approach. Osteomyelitis is not an uncommon occurrence and must be initially ruled out in all full thickness pressure ulcers. Surgical debridement of necrotic tissue is necessary prior to further treatment and assessments. Antibiotic therapy is indicated only upon evidence of infection (cellulitis, osteomyelitis, leukocytosis, bandemia, or fever). Topical pharmacologic agents may be used to prevent or treat infection but must be carefully controlled to avoid such adverse effects as toxicity to the wound, allergic reaction, and development of resistant pathogens.

When an ulcer occurs, examining it (i.e., size, location, type of affected tissue, leaking fluid, odor, wound openings, wear and tea, and infection) and the severity of the ulcer are essential to wound assessment. Treatment includes managing nearby and far-away infetions, removing dead body tissue, maintaining a moist environment for wound healing, and even surgery. Removing damaged body tissue (debridement) is needed when dead tissue is present. Urgent debridement should be done if bacterial skin infections develop. Physical removal, use of a chemical topical, and natural forms of debridement are nonurgent treatments. Wound cleaning, preferably with salt water and appropriate bandages, are common treatment for clean bedsores and after removing damaged body tissue. Bacteria can be managed with cleaning. Antibiotics applied skin-level should be considered if there is no healing after 14 days. Full-body antibiotics are used in those with developing skin infections, inflammation, or full-body infection.",2,C

38,28631809,"Background: Pressure ulcers, also known as bed sores, pressure sores or decubitus ulcers develop as a result of a localised injury to the skin or underlying tissue, or both. The ulcers usually arise over a bony prominence, and are recognised as a common medical problem affecting people confined to a bed or wheelchair for long periods of time. Anabolic steroids are used as off-label drugs (drugs which are used without regulatory approval) and have been used as adjuvants to usual treatment with dressings, debridement, nutritional supplements, systemic antibiotics and antiseptics, which are considered to be supportive in healing of pressure ulcers. Anabolic steroids are considered because of their ability to stimulate protein synthesis and build muscle mass. Comprehensive evidence is required to facilitate decision making, regarding the benefits and harms of using anabolic steroids. Objectives: To assess the effects of anabolic steroids for treating pressure ulcers. Main results: The review contains only one trial with a total of 212 participants, all with spinal cord injury and open pressure ulcers classed as stage III and IV. The participants were mainly male (98.2%, 106/108) with a mean age of 58.4 (standard deviation 10.4) years in the oxandrolone group and were all male (100%, 104/104) with a mean age of 57.3 (standard deviation 11.6) years in the placebo group. This trial compared oxandrolone (20 mg/day, administered orally) with a dose of placebo (an inactive substance consisting of 98% starch and 2% magnesium stearate) and reported data on complete healing of ulcers and adverse events. There was very low-certainty evidence on the relative effect of oxandrolone on complete ulcer healing at the end of a 24-week treatment period (risk ratio RR) 0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.52 to 1.26) (downgraded twice for imprecision due to an extremely wide 95% CI, which spanned both benefit and harm, and once for indirectness, as the participants were mostly male spinal cord injury patients). Thus, we are uncertain whether oxandrolone improves or reduces the complete healing of pressure ulcers, as we assessed the certainty of the evidence as very low. There was low-certainty evidence on the risk of non-serious adverse events reported in participants treated with oxandrolone compared with placebo (RR 3.85, 95% CI 1.12 to 13.26) (downgraded once for imprecision and once for indirectness, as the participants were mostly male spinal cord injury patients). Thus, the treatment with oxandrolone may increase the risk of non-serious adverse events reported in participants. There was very low-certainty evidence on the risk of serious adverse events reported in participants treated with oxandrolone compared with placebo (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.17) (downgraded twice for imprecision due to an extremely wide 95% CI, which spanned both benefit and harm, and once for indirectness, as the participants were mostly male spinal cord injury patients). Of the five serious adverse events reported in the oxandrolone-treated group, none were classed by the trial teams as being related to treatment. We are uncertain whether oxandrolone increases or decreases the risk of serious adverse events as we assessed the certainty of the evidence as very low. Secondary outcomes such as pain, length of hospital stay, change in wound size or wound surface area, incidence of different type of infection, cost of treatment and quality of life were not reported in the included trial. Overall the evidence in this study was of very low quality (downgraded for imprecision and indirectness).

Objectives: To assess the clinical and cost effectiveness of foam wound dressings for healing pressure ulcers in people with an existing pressure ulcer in any care setting. Main results: We included nine trials with a total of 483 participants, all of whom were adults (59 years or older) with an existing pressure ulcer Category/Stage II or above. All trials had two arms, which compared foam dressings with other dressings for treating pressure ulcers. The certainty of evidence ranged from low to very low due to various combinations of selection, performance, attrition, detection and reporting bias, and imprecision due to small sample sizes and wide confidence intervals. We had very little confidence in the estimate of effect of included studies. Where a foam dressing was compared with another foam dressing, we established that the true effect was likely to be substantially less than the study's estimated effect. We present data for four comparisons. One trial compared a silicone foam dressing with another (hydropolymer) foam dressing (38 participants), with an eight-week (short-term) follow-up. It was uncertain whether alternate types of foam dressing affected the incidence of healed pressure ulcers (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.75) or adverse events (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.25), as the certainty of evidence was very low, downgraded for serious limitations in study design and very serious imprecision. Four trials with a median sample size of 20 participants (230 participants), compared foam dressings with hydrocolloid dressings for eight weeks or less (short-term). It was uncertain whether foam dressings affected the probability of healing in comparison to hydrocolloid dressings over a short follow-up period in three trials (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.34), very low-certainty evidence, downgraded for very serious study limitations and serious imprecision. It was uncertain if there was a difference in risk of adverse events between groups (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.37 to 2.11), very low-certainty evidence, downgraded for serious study limitations and very serious imprecision. Reduction in ulcer size, patient satisfaction/acceptability, pain and cost effectiveness data were also reported but we assessed the evidence as being of very low certainty. One trial (34 participants), compared foam and hydrogel dressings over an eight-week (short-term) follow-up. It was uncertain if the foam dressing affected the probability of healing (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.28), time to complete healing (MD 5.67 days 95% CI -4.03 to 15.37), adverse events (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.65) or reduction in ulcer size (MD 0.30 cm2 per day, 95% CI -0.15 to 0.75), as the certainty of the evidence was very low, downgraded for serious study limitations and very serious imprecision. The remaining three trials (181 participants) compared foam with basic wound contact dressings. Follow-up times ranged from short-term (8 weeks or less) to medium-term (8 to 24 weeks). It was uncertain whether foam dressings affected the probability of healing compared with basic wound contact dressings, in the short term (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.62 to 2.88) or medium term (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.72), or affected time to complete healing in the medium term (MD -35.80 days, 95% CI -56.77 to -14.83), or adverse events in the medium term (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.05).

Reduction in ulcer size, patient satisfaction/acceptability, pain and cost effectiveness data were also reported but again, we assessed the evidence as being of very low certainty.

Levels of frontal gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA+) and myo-inositol relative to creatine (mI/tCr) were predicted by age. Levels of GABA+ predicted cognitive performance better than mI/tCr. Additionally, we found that frontal levels of n-acetylaspartate relative to creatine (tNAA/tCr) were predicted by levels of t-tau. In cognitively normal older adults, levels of frontal GABA+ and mI/t Cr are predicted by aging, with levels of GABA+ decreasing with age and the opposite for mI/tCr.

Levels of frontal gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA+) and myo-inositol relative to creatine (mI/tCr) were predicted by age. Levels of GABA+ predicted cognitive performance better than mI/tCr. Additionally, we found that frontal levels of n-acetylaspartate relative to creatine (tNAA/tCr) were predicted by levels of t-tau. In cognitively normal older adults, levels of frontal GABA+ and mI/t Cr are predicted by aging, with levels of GABA+ decreasing with age and the opposite for mI/tCr. These results suggest that age- and biomarker-related changes in brain metabolites are not only located in the posterior cortex as suggested by previous studies and further demonstrate that MRS is a viable tool in the study of aging and biomarkers associated with pathological aging and Alzheimer's disease.","Increased amounts of β-amyloid (Aβ1-42) and tau, biological proteins, are considered risk factors for Alzheimer's disease in healthy, older adults. We tested the effect of aging and Aβ1-42 and tau amounts in brain and spine fluid on 1) energy molecules in the front of the brain and 2) reasoning skills in 144 older adults. Levels of specific chemical signal molecules (GABA+) and sugars (mI/tCr) in the brain were linked to age. Levels of the GABA+ trended with reasoning skills better than Mi/tCr. We found that levels of a specific chemical molecule were linked to levels of t-tau. In normal older adults, the specific chemical signal molecule GABA+ decreased with age while the chemical sugar mI/tCR increased with age. Age- and biomarker-related changes in brain molecules are not only located in the back of the brain as other studies show and that using a radio-wave tool can help study aging and biomarkers linked with aging diseases and Alzheimer's.",2,B
39,34600555,"Background: Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have attracted increasing attention in recent years for their potential application as disease biomarkers due to their high abundance and stability. In this study, we attempted to screen circRNAs that can be used to predict postoperative recurrence and survival in patients with gastric cancer (GC). Methods: High-throughput RNA sequencing was used to identify differentially expressed circRNAs in GC patients with different prognoses. The expression level of circRNAs in the training set (n = 136) and validation set (n = 167) was detected by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Kaplan-Meier estimator, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and cox regression analysis were used to evaluate the prognostic value of circRNAs on recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) in GC patients. CeRNA network prediction, gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses were performed for the circRNAs with prognostic significance. Results: A total of 259 differentially expressed circRNAs were identified in GC patients with different RFS. We found two circRNAs (hsa_circ_0005092 and hsa_circ_0002647) that highly expressed in GC patients with good prognoses, and subsequently established a predictive model for postoperative recurrence and prognosis evaluation, named circPanel. Patients with circPanellow might have shorter recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS). We also performed circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network prediction and functional analysis for hsa_circ_0005092 and hsa_circ_0002647. Conclusions: CircPanel has the potential to be a prognostic biomarker in GC patients with greater accuracy than a single circRNA and certain traditional tumor markers (e.g., CEA, CA19-9 and CA724).","Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a special class of RNAs that do not transcribe into (result into) proteins.

Biomarkers are measurable, biological substances that can indicate disease in a patient. The authors aimed to screen circRNAs that can be used to predict post-operation recurrence and survival in patients with gastric cancer (GC), cancer of the stomach. Tests were used to identify differentially (uniquely) expressed circRNAs in GC patients with different prognoses or forecasts of the disease. The expression level of circRNAs in the training and validation sets were detected by laboratory testing. Training and validation sets are used in scientific modeling to train the artificial intelligence machine and then validate its output, respectively. Several statistical tests were used to predict the amount of circRNAs on recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) in GC patients. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) refers to the time between the day of diagnosis of a disease and the day the patient relapses into illness. Overall survival (OS) refers to the time from the day of disease diagnosis that the patients are still alive. Several bioinformatics tests evaluating disease recurrence and gene expression were performed for the circRNAs with prognostic significance (estimating the future disease course). A total of 259 differentially expressed circRNAs were identified in GC patients with different RFS. Two circRNAs were highly expressed in GC patients with good prognoses. These results established a predictive model for postoperative recurrence (disease relapse) and prognosis evaluation (likely course of disease), named circPanel. Patients with circPanellow might have shorter recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS).

39,34599830,"Recent studies have shown that nitric oxide (NO) is a central mediator in diseases occurring with thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA), such as Marfan syndrome (MFS). The progressive dilation of the aorta in TAA ultimately leads to aortic dissection. Unfortunately, current medical treatments neither halt aortic enlargement nor prevent rupture, leaving surgical repair as the only effective treatment. There is therefore a pressing need for effective therapies to delay or even avoid the need for surgical repair in TAA patients. Here, we summarize the mechanisms through which NO signalling dysregulation causes TAA, particularly in MFS and discuss recent advances based on the identification of new MFS mediators related to pathway overactivation that represent potential disease biomarkers. Likewise, we propose iNOS, sGC, and PRKG1, whose pharmacological inhibition reverses aortopathy in MFS mice, as targets for therapeutic intervention in TAA and candidates for clinical trials.","Recent studies have shown that nitric oxide (NO) is a key mediator (regulator) in diseases occurring with thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA), such as Marfan syndrome (MFS).

Further, we applied Aβ and tau classification system (AT system) in patients with PPA for whom additional information of in vivo tau biomarker was available. Methods: We recruited 110 patients with PPA (41 semantic [svPPA], 27 non-fluent [nfvPPA], 32 logopenic [lvPPA], and 10 unclassified [ucPPA]) who underwent Aβ-PET imaging at multi centers. The extent of language impairment and cortical atrophy were compared between the A+ and A-PPA subgroups using general linear models. Results: The prevalence of Aβ positivity was highest in patients with lvPPA (81.3%), followed by ucPPA (60.0%), nfvPPA (18.5%), and svPPA (9.8%).

Semantic PPA is characterized by loss of language function. Non-fluent PPA is characterized by the gradual loss of speech. Logopenic PPA is characterized by difficulty in naming and sentence repetition. All recruits underwent Aβ-PET (brain scan) imaging at multi centers.

We designed anti-miRs to individually inhibit miR-17, miR-18, miR-19 or miR-25 families in an orthologous ADPKD model. Treatment with anti-miRs against the miR-17 family reduced cyst proliferation, kidney-weight-to-body-weight ratio and cyst index.

41,18497742,"In patients with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease, renal cysts and clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) arise from renal tubular epithelial cells containing biallelic inactivation of the VHL tumour suppressor gene. However, it is presumed that formation of renal cysts and their conversion to ccRCC involve additional genetic changes at other loci. Here, we show that cystic lesions in the kidneys of patients with VHL disease also demonstrate activation of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) pathway. Strikingly, combined conditional inactivation of Vhlh and the Pten tumour suppressor gene, which normally antagonises PI3K signalling, in the mouse kidney, elicits cyst formation after short latency, whereas inactivation of either tumour suppressor gene alone failed to produce such a phenotype. Interestingly, cells lining these cysts frequently lack a primary cilium, a microtubule-based cellular antenna important for suppression of uncontrolled kidney epithelial cell proliferation and cyst formation. Our results support a model in which the PTEN tumour suppressor protein cooperates with pVHL to suppress cyst development in the kidney.","In patients with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease, kidney cysts (growths) and clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), a type of kidney cancer, come from cells in the kidneys called epithelial cells that inactivate (or turn off) the VHL gene.

However, it is believed that formation of kidney cysts and their change to the ccRCC kidney cancer involve additional genetic changes at other locations. This study shows that cystic wounds in the kidneys of patients with VHL disease also show activation of the enzyme called phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, which regulates key cells processes. When two genes called Vhlh and Pten that keep cells from growing too fast are turned off, this brings about cyst formation in the kidneys of mice after a short delay. However, inactivation of only one of these genes fails to produce this same effect. Interestingly, cells lining these cysts frequently lack primary cilium, that acts like a cell antenna and is important for stopping or slowing kidney epithelial cells from multiplying and for stopping cyst formation.

41,17965720,"Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is an important cause of end-stage renal disease, for which there is no proven therapy. Mutations in PKD1 (the gene encoding polycystin-1) are the principal cause of this disease. The disease begins in utero and is slowly progressive, but it is not known whether cystogenesis is an ongoing process during adult life. We now show that inactivation of Pkd1 in mice before postnatal day 13 results in severely cystic kidneys within 3 weeks, whereas inactivation at day 14 and later results in cysts only after 5 months. We found that cellular proliferation was not appreciably higher in cystic specimens than in age-matched controls, but the abrupt change in response to Pkd1 inactivation corresponded to a previously unrecognized brake point during renal growth and significant changes in gene expression. These findings suggest that the effects of Pkd1 inactivation are defined by a developmental switch that signals the end of the terminal renal maturation process. Our studies show that Pkd1 regulates tubular morphology in both developing and adult kidney, but the pathologic consequences of inactivation are defined by the organ's developmental status. These results have important implications for clinical understanding of the disease and therapeutic approaches.","Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is an inherited disease that causes many cysts (growths) usually in the kidneys, and is an important cause of end-stage kidney disease, for which there is no proven therapy.

The disease begins before birth and develops slowly, but it is not known whether the development and growth of cysts is an ongoing process during adult life.

However, the sudden change of Pkd1 becoming inactive matched a stopping point of kidney growth that is not previously recognized and matched significant changes in how the gene functions. These findings suggest that the effects of inactivating the Pkd1 gene are like a switch that signals the end of the end-stage kidney process. These studies show that Pkd1 regulates changes in both developing kidneys and in adult kidneys, but the process of inactivation are defined by the stage of the organ's development.

41,17965720,"Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is an important cause of end-stage renal disease, for which there is no proven therapy. Mutations in PKD1 (the gene encoding polycystin-1) are the principal cause of this disease. The disease begins in utero and is slowly progressive, but it is not known whether cystogenesis is an ongoing process during adult life. We now show that inactivation of Pkd1 in mice before postnatal day 13 results in severely cystic kidneys within 3 weeks, whereas inactivation at day 14 and later results in cysts only after 5 months. We found that cellular proliferation was not appreciably higher in cystic specimens than in age-matched controls, but the abrupt change in response to Pkd1 inactivation corresponded to a previously unrecognized brake point during renal growth and significant changes in gene expression. These findings suggest that the effects of Pkd1 inactivation are defined by a developmental switch that signals the end of the terminal renal maturation process. Our studies show that Pkd1 regulates tubular morphology in both developing and adult kidney, but the pathologic consequences of inactivation are defined by the organ's developmental status. These results have important implications for clinical understanding of the disease and therapeutic approaches.","An inherited disorder of many kidney cysts (swellings) is an important cause of kidney failure, for which there is no treatment.

We show that silencing of Pkd1 in mice younger than 13 days leads to severely cystic kidneys within 3 weeks. Silencing at day 14 or later results in cysts only after 4 months. We found that cell growth is not higher in those with cysts versus similar-age healthy animals, but the sudden change in response to Pkd1 silencing was linked to a new brake point during kidney growth and changes in gene expression. The effects of Pkd1 silencing may be defined by a developmental switch that signals the end of the final kidney maturation process. Pkd1 monitors development of tubes in growing and adult kidneys, but the disease-related effects of silencing are defined by the organ's developmental status.

41,34486178,"Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is a common inherited renal disorder that results from mutations in either PKD1 or PKD2, encoding polycystin-1 (PC1) and polycystin-2 (PC2), respectively. Downregulation or overexpression of PKD1 or PKD2 in mouse models results in renal cyst formation, suggesting that the quantity of PC1 and PC2 needs to be maintained within a tight functional window to prevent cystogenesis. Here we show that enhanced PC2 expression is a common feature of PKD1 mutant tissues, in part due to an increase in Pkd2 mRNA. However, our data also suggest that more effective protein folding contributes to the augmented levels of PC2. We demonstrate that the unfolded protein response is activated in Pkd1 knockout kidneys and in Pkd1 mutant cells and that this is coupled with increased levels of GRP94, an endoplasmic reticulum protein that is a member of the HSP90 family of chaperones. GRP94 was found to physically interact with PC2 and depletion or chemical inhibition of GRP94 led to a decrease in PC2, suggesting that GRP94 serves as its chaperone. Moreover, GRP94 is acetylated and binds to histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6), a known deacetylase and activator of HSP90 proteins. Inhibition of HDAC6 decreased PC2 suggesting that HDAC6 and GRP94 work together to regulate PC2 levels. Lastly, we showed that inhibition of GRP94 prevents cAMP-induced cyst formation in vitro. Taken together our data uncovered a novel HDAC6-GRP94-related axis that likely participates in maintaining elevated PC2 levels in Pkd1 mutant cells.","Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is a common inherited kidney disorder that causes many cysts (growths) and is caused by changes in either the PKD1 or PKD2 genes. These genes are used to make the proteins polycystin-1 (PC1) and polycystin-2 (PC2), which regulate cells growth, cell movement, and interaction with other cells. In experiments with mice, when the PKD1 or PKD2 genes are less sensitive to other cells or make too many proteins, it may lead to cysts forming in the kidneys. This suggests that the number of PC1 and PC2 proteins needs to be stable within a brief time period to prevent the formation of cysts. In this study, researchers show that more cells and proteins from PC2 is a common feature of PKD1 changes, in part because of an increase in PKD2. However, this data also suggests that more effective protein folding, which is when a protein changes from a long chain to a functional shape, contributes to more levels of PC2 proteins. Researchers show that the unfolded protein response is active in the kidneys without Pkd1 and in Pkd1 mutant (changed) cells. This effect is in addition to increases in the number of an endoplasmic reticulum protein, called GRP94. The endoplasmic reticulum helps create and package proteins in cells. GRP94 is found to physically interact with PC2, and reducing or slowing GRP94 can lead to a decrease in PC2, suggesting that GRP94 serves as its chaperone (plays a part in the folding of itself as a protein). Also, GRP94 is acetylated (modified structurally) and attaches to histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6), an enzyme that can control several important proteins and activate other proteins. Slowing or stopping HDAC6 decreases PC2 proteins, suggesting that HDAC6 and GRP94 work together to regulate PC2 levels. Lastly, researchers show that the slowing of GRP94 prevents the formation of cysts in laboratory tests. Together, these data uncover a new HDAC6-GRP94-related point that likely participates in maintaining higher PC2 levels in Pkd1 mutant cells.",1,B
41,34155062,"Background: In autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), cyst development and enlargement lead to ESKD. Macrophage recruitment and interstitial inflammation promote cyst growth. TWEAK is a TNF superfamily (TNFSF) cytokine that regulates inflammatory responses, cell proliferation, and cell death, and its receptor Fn14 (TNFRSF12a) is expressed in macrophage and nephron epithelia. Methods: To evaluate the role of the TWEAK signaling pathway in cystic disease, we evaluated Fn14 expression in human and in an orthologous murine model of ADPKD. We also explored the cystic response to TWEAK signaling pathway activation and inhibition by peritoneal injection. Results: Meta-analysis of published animal-model data of cystic disease reveals mRNA upregulation of several components of the TWEAK signaling pathway. We also observed that TWEAK and Fn14 were overexpressed in mouse ADPKD kidney cysts, and TWEAK was significantly high in urine and cystic fluid from patients with ADPKD. TWEAK administration induced cystogenesis and increased cystic growth, worsening the phenotype in a murine ADPKD model. Anti-TWEAK antibodies significantly slowed the progression of ADPKD, preserved renal function, and improved survival. Furthermore, the anti-TWEAK cystogenesis reduction is related to decreased cell proliferation-related MAPK signaling, decreased NF-κB pathway activation, a slight reduction of fibrosis and apoptosis, and an indirect decrease in macrophage recruitment. Conclusions: This study identifies the TWEAK signaling pathway as a new disease mechanism involved in cystogenesis and cystic growth and may lead to a new therapeutic approach in ADPKD.","In autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), an inherited disorder that causes cysts (growths) in the kidneys, cyst development and enlargement lead to end-stage kidney disease. The recruitment of macrophage cells (a type of white blood cell that surrounds and kills microorganisms, removes dead cells, and activates other immune system cells) and spaces between the kidney becoming swollen are found to promote cyst growth. TWEAK is a type of cytokine (chemical messenger) that regulates inflammatory (infection-fighting) responses, cell growth and division, and cell death. Its receptor Fn14 (TNFRSF12a) that sends and receives signals is expressed in macrophages and a layer of outer lining cells in the kidney called nephron epithelia. To evaluate how the TWEAK cytokine signaling plays a role in cystic disease, researchers evaluate the Fn14 gene development in humans and in experiments with animals of ADPKD. Researchers also looked at the response from cysts to the activation of TWEAK signaling as well as its limited signaling by injections. Data published from animal studies of cystic disease show increases in mRNA (genetic strands with instructions to build proteins) of several parts of the TWEAK signaling pathway. Researchers also found that too many TWEAK and Fn14 gene-derived molecules are in made in mouse ADPKD kidney cysts, and TWEAK is very high in the urine and cystic fluid from patients with ADPKD. TWEAK use started formation of cysts and increased cystic growth, worsening physical traits in an animal ADPKD model. Anti-TWEAK antibodies (a protein used by the immune system to identify and neutralize foreign objects such as harmful bacteria and viruses) significantly slowed the progression of ADPKD, protected kidney function, and improved survival. Additionally, the reduction of cyst formation is related to decreased cell growth and a decrease in macrophage recruitment. In conclusion, this study identifies the TWEAK signaling pathway as a new disease process involved in the growth and formation of many cysts and may lead to a new treatment approach in ADPKD.",1,B

41,33549515,"DNA damage and alterations in DNA damage response (DDR) signaling could be one of the molecular mechanisms mediating focal kidney cyst formation in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that markers of DNA damage and DDR signaling are increased in human and experimental ADPKD. In the human ADPKD transcriptome, the number of up-regulated DDR-related genes was increased by 16.6-fold compared with that in normal kidney, and by 2.5-fold in cystic compared with that in minimally cystic tissue (P < 0.0001). In end-stage human ADPKD tissue, γ-H2A histone family member X (H2AX), phosphorylated ataxia telangiectasia and radiation-sensitive mutant 3 (Rad3)-related (pATR), and phosphorylated ataxia telangiectasia mutated (pATM) localized to cystic kidney epithelial cells. In vitro, pATR and pATM were also constitutively increased in human ADPKD tubular cells (WT 9-7 and 9-12) compared with control (HK-2). In addition, extrinsic oxidative DNA damage by hydrogen peroxide augmented γ-H2AX and cell survival in human ADPKD cells, and exacerbated cyst growth in the three-dimensional Madin-Darby canine kidney cyst model. In contrast, DDR-related gene expression was only transiently increased on postnatal day 0 in Pkd1RC/RC mice, and not altered at later time points up to 12 months of age. In conclusion, DDR signaling is dysregulated in human ADPKD and during the early phases of murine ADPKD. The constitutive expression of the DDR pathway in ADPKD may promote survival of PKD1-mutated cells and contribute to kidney cyst growth.","Damage to DNA and changes to the body's response to DNA damage, called DNA damage response or DDR, could be one of the processes involved in the development of kidney cysts (growths) in the inherited disease called autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). This study aims to test the idea that certain types of DNA damage and DDR signaling are increased in ADPKD experiments. In the part of the human ADPKD genes that transfer information to molecules, the DNA damage response (DDR) genes increased 16 times compared with that in a normal kidney. DDR also more than doubled in tissues with cysts compared to DDR in tissues with few cysts. In tissues from end-stage human ADPKD, certain genes and protein enzymes involved in the DDR to detect and repair damaged DNA focus on cystic kidney epithelial cells, which are important cells for kidney function. In lab tests, protein enzymes are also increased in human ADPKD cells located in the tubal duct system of the kidneys when compared with normal tubal cells. Additionally, some DNA damage increases genes and cell survival in human ADPKD cells, and worsens cyst growth in one animal experiment. In contrast, DNA damage response (DDR) gene processing is only temporarily increased on the day of birth in mice, and not altered at later times up to 12 months of age. In conclusion, DDR signals to other cells are not controlled well in human ADPKD and during the early phases of animal ADPKD. The use of the DNA damage response in ADPKD may promote survival of gene cells that have mutated (changed) and contribute to cyst growth in the kidneys.",1,B
41,33536341,"Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is caused by mutations in either TSC1 or TSC2 genes and affects multiple organs, including kidney, lung, and brain. In the kidney, TSC presents with the enlargement of benign tumors (angiomyolipomata) and cysts, which eventually leads to kidney failure. The factors promoting cyst formation and tumor growth in TSC are incompletely understood. Here, we report that mice with principal cell-specific inactivation of Tsc1 develop numerous cortical cysts, which are overwhelmingly composed of hyperproliferating A-intercalated (A-IC) cells. RNA sequencing and confirmatory expression studies demonstrated robust expression of Forkhead Transcription Factor 1 (Foxi1) and its downstream targets, apical H+-ATPase and cytoplasmic carbonic anhydrase 2 (CAII), in cyst epithelia in Tsc1 knockout (KO) mice but not in Pkd1 mutant mice. In addition, the electrogenic 2Cl-/H+ exchanger (CLC-5) is significantly up-regulated and shows remarkable colocalization with H+-ATPase on the apical membrane of cyst epithelia in Tsc1 KO mice. Deletion of Foxi1, which is vital to intercalated cells viability and H+-ATPase expression, completely abrogated the cyst burden in Tsc1 KO mice, as indicated by MRI images and histological analysis in kidneys of Foxi1/Tsc1 double-knockout (dKO) mice. Deletion of CAII, which is critical to H+-ATPase activation, caused significant reduction in cyst burden and increased life expectancy in CAII/Tsc1 dKO mice vs. Tsc1 KO mice. We propose that intercalated cells and their acid/base/electrolyte transport machinery (H+-ATPase/CAII/CLC-5) are critical to cystogenesis, and their inhibition or inactivation is associated with significant protection against cyst generation and/or enlargement in TSC.","Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a rare disease that leads to noncancerous (benign) tumors forming in the body.

The factors promoting cyst formation and tumor growth in TSC are not completely understood. In this study, researchers report that mice with inactivation (turning off) of specific cells develop many cysts in the kidney. Past studies with mice show an increase of the Forkhead Transcription Factor 1 (Foxi1) gene that impacts cell processing in cyst epithelia cells, which are important cells for kidney function. Also, some gene processing is increased and work together with proton pumps called H+-ATPase, which regulate functions such as nutrient intake and regulating acids between cells, on the lining of epithelial cysts cells in mice. Deletion of the Foxi1 gene, which is key to the survival of cells and H+-ATPase processing, overrides the cyst burden in Tsc1 mice. Deletion of the enzyme CAII causes major decreases in cyst burden and increased life expectancy in mice without CAII and Tsc1 versus mice without just Tsc1. Researchers suggest that epithelial cells in the kidneys and their transport mechanisms are important to the formation of many cysts, and slowing or stopping them is associated with significant protection against cyst development and/or enlargement in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC).",1,B

43,27324363,"There have been significant advances in pacing and implantable defibrillator technology over the past decade. The relationships between ventricular activation sequence and cardiac mechanical performance are now better appreciated, and will become more completely understood. Even in the setting of infra-His block and bundle branch block, ventricular activation over the Purkinje system can now be achieved in many patients with direct pacing of the His bundle, providing a more physiologic alternative to RV pacing that should avoid pacing induced ventricular dysfunction, as well as provide an alternative to left ventricular pacing for CRT. Advances in the lead technology will increase ease and use of this form of pacing. When activation of the ventricles from the His Purkinje system is not feasible, LV pacing for cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) will continue to be important for patients with depressed ventricular function associated with left bundle branch block. Surprisingly, CRT is often beneficial even though present implementation is limited to the few LV pacing sites accessible through the coronary venous system. The advent of pacing leads with multiple electrodes for placement in the coronary venous system is a notable advance, that in contrast to traditional bipolar leads, provides multiple LV pacing configurations from which to select the optimal site for LV pacing without compromising lead stability. This option also addresses problems of phrenic nerve stimulation and high pacing thresholds that often limit delivery of LV pacing. These leads will also allow performance of simultaneous pacing from multiple LV sites, which may improve mechanical performance in situations other than left bundle branch block.","Over the past decade, there have been major advances in the development of pacemakers and the implantable defibrillator, a device that monitors your heart rate and delivers a strong electrical shock to restore the heartbeat to normal.

Activating the lower chambers of the heart (ventricular activation) can now be achieved in many patients with pacing of the His bundle (a part of the electrical conduction system of the heart that transmits pulses). This approach provides an alternative to right ventricle pacing that may cause ventricles in the heart to not function properly. Advances in the technology will increase ease and use of this form of pacing. When it is not possible to activate the ventricles from the His Purkinje system that is the rapid electric conduction in the ventricles, left ventricle pacing for cardiac resynchronization therapy or CRT (treatment that helps the heart beat at the right rhythm) will continue to be important for patients with slower ventricular function.

43,30252257,"Pacemakers are adjustable artificial electrical pulse generators, frequently emitting a pulse with a duration between 0.5 and 25 milliseconds with an output of 0.1 to 15 volts, at a frequency up to 300 times per minute. The cardiologist or pacemaker technologist will be able to interrogate and control the pacing rate, the pulse width, and the voltage, whether the device is temporary or permanent. Pacemakers are typically categorized as external or internal. The external variety is almost always placed for temporary stabilization of the patient or to facilitate some type of surgical procedure. The implantable type is usually permanent and often, significantly more complex than the temporary, external variety. Pacemakers are one type of cardiac implantable electronic devices (known as CIED). This broad category also includes implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs). Collectively, this group of devices was first introduced in the 1950s, shortly after the advent of the transistor. As technology has improved, so has the pacemaker device. The first implantable ICD was developed in 1980, and since that time, it has become more difficult to differentiate between pacemakers and ICDs. This is because every ICD currently implanted has an anti-bradycardia pacing function. It is critical for the patient and any health care provider to understand which device has been implanted to prevent unnecessary ICD therapy. This is most likely to occur with any electromagnetic interference (EMI) and could lead to activation of the device (if it is an ICD). Most types of CIED use several insulated lead wires with non-insulated tips that are implanted in the heart, either by percutaneous vein insertion or directly by a cardiac surgeon.

The implantable type is usually permanent and often much more complex than the temporary, external variety. Pacemakers are one type of a cardiac implantable electronic device (known as CIED). This broad category also includes implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs), which are devices designed to directly treat a slow heart rate.

As technology has improved, so has the pacemaker device. The first implantable ICD was developed in 1980, and since that time, it has become more difficult to tell the difference between pacemakers and ICDs. This is because every ICD currently implanted has an anti-bradycardia (anti-slow-heart-rate) pacing function. It is critical for the patient and any health care provider to understand which device has been implanted to prevent unnecessary ICD therapy. This is most likely to occur with interference by another electrical device and could lead to activation of the device (if it is an ICD).

We present a newly developed, clinically oriented classification of the various types of shock and their therapeutic implications. Results: There are only four major categories of shock, each of which is mainly related to one of four organ systems. Hypovolemic shock relates to the blood and fluids compartment while distributive shock relates to the vascular system; cardiogenic shock arises from primary cardiac dysfunction; and obstructive shock arises from a blockage of the circulation. Hypovolemic shock is due to intravascular volume loss and is treated by fluid replacement with balanced crystalloids. Distributive shock, on the other hand, is a state of relative hypovolemia resulting from pathological redistribution of the absolute intravascular volume and is treated with a combination of vasoconstrictors and fluid replacement. Cardiogenic shock is due to inadequate function of the heart, which shall be treated, depending on the situation, with drugs, surgery, or other interventional procedures. In obstructive shock, hypoperfusion due to elevated resistance shall be treated with an immediate life-saving intervention. Pathogenesis and pathophysiology: The characteristic feature of both, hemorrhagic and traumatic hemorrhagic shock is bleeding. However, differences exist between the two subcategories in terms of the extent of soft tissue damage. Clinically the most significant cause of hemorrhagic shock is acute bleeding from an isolated injury to a large blood vessel, gastrointestinal bleeding, nontraumatic vascular rupture (e.g., aortic aneurysm), obstetric hemorrhage (e.g., uterine atony), and hemorrhage in the region of the ear, nose, and throat (vascular erosion).

44,30068251,"Hypovolemic shock exists as a spectrum, with its early stages characterized by subtle pathophysiologic tissue insults and its late stages defined by multi-system organ dysfunction. The importance of timely detection of shock is well known, as early interventions improve mortality, while delays render these same interventions ineffective. However, detection is limited by the monitors, parameters, and vital signs that are traditionally used in the intensive care unit (ICU). Many parameters change minimally during the early stages, and when they finally become abnormal, hypovolemic shock has already occurred. The compensatory reserve (CR) is a parameter that represents a new paradigm for assessing physiologic status, as it comprises the sum total of compensatory mechanisms that maintain adequate perfusion to vital organs during hypovolemia. When these mechanisms are overwhelmed, hemodynamic instability and circulatory collapse will follow. Previous studies involving CR measurements demonstrated their utility in detecting central blood volume loss before hemodynamic parameters and vital signs changed. Measurements of the CR have also been used in clinical studies involving patients with traumatic injuries or bleeding, and the results from these studies have been promising. Moreover, these measurements can be made at the bedside, and they provide a real-time assessment of hemodynamic stability. Given the need for rapid diagnostics when treating critically ill patients, CR measurements would complement parameters that are currently being used. Consequently, the purpose of this article is to introduce a conceptual framework where the CR represents a new approach to monitoring critically ill patients. Within this framework, we present evidence to support the notion that the use of the CR could potentially improve the outcomes of ICU patients by alerting intensivists to impending hypovolemic shock before its onset.","Hypovolemic shock is a spectrum of reactions.

CR measurements can be made at the bedside. They also provide a real-time assessment of blood flow. There is a need for rapid diagnostics when treating critically ill patients. CR measurements would complement parameters that are currently being used. The aim of this article is to introduce a conceptual framework where the CR represents a new approach to monitoring critically ill patients. Within this framework, the authors present evidence to support the how the use of the CR could potentially improve the outcomes of ICU patients. CR could improve alerting doctors to impending hypovolemic shock before its onset.",1,C
44,28346013,"Development of a human model of hemorrhage has provided a unique opportunity to investigate the underlying physiology that defines the individual capacity to avoid the life-threatening clinical condition of inadequate tissue oxygenation known as “shock.” The experimental approach of progressively reducing central blood volume to the point of hemodynamic decompensation with the use of lower body negative pressure has revealed stark distinctions in the physiological compensatory responses between individuals with high compared with low tolerances to blood loss. High tolerance to hemorrhage is defined by a capacity to maintain systemic perfusion pressure and reduce the rate of cerebral hypoperfusion by: (1) protecting cardiac output with greater elevations in heart rate associated with greater cardiac vagal withdrawal and sympathetically mediated adrenergic stimulation; (2) greater increases in systemic peripheral vascular resistance associated with higher sympathetic nerve activation and levels of circulating vasopressor endocrine responses; (3) alternating blood flow between the brain and peripheral tissue with greater sympathetically mediated oscillatory patterns of systemic pressure and flow; and (4) enhancing cardiac filling and cerebral perfusion pressure gradient by optimizing the respiratory pump. When the capacity for these compensatory responses is exhausted, an active vasodilation drops resistance to blood flow allowing for increased perfusion of peripheral tissue. When cardiac filling is no longer adequate to maintain systemic pressure and flow, a reflex-mediated pronounced bradycardia leads to the initiation of decompensatory shock.","A human model of hemorrhage (excessive bleeding) provides the opportunity to investigate the underlying mechanisms that can help someone avoid the life-threatening condition of inadequate tissue oxygenation known as ""shock."" This is completed by experimentally reducing central blood volume. Blood volume is progressively decreased to the point of critically low blood pressure. This test approach has shown differences in the bodily responses between individuals with high tolerances versus low tolerances to blood loss. High tolerance to hemorrhage is defined by maintaining body wide blood flow pressure and prevent decreased brain blood pressure. This is done by one of four ways. First, by protecting cardiac output with greater elevations in heart rate associated with greater cardiac vagal withdrawal and sympathetically mediated adrenergic stimulation. Second, a greater increases in systemic peripheral vascular resistance (blood vessel resistance) associated with higher sympathetic nerve activation (fight-or-flight reaction) and levels of circulating vasopressor endocrine responses (responses from chemical messengers). Third, an alternating blood flow between the brain and peripheral tissue with greater sympathetically mediated oscillatory patterns of systemic pressure and flow. Lastly, by enhancing cardiac filling and cerebral perfusion pressure gradient (pressure driving oxygen to brain tissue) by optimizing the respiratory pump (muscles that help the lung extract and contract). When these compensatory responses are exhausted, an active vasodilation (enlargement of blood vessels) drops resistance to blood flow allowing for increased perfusion of peripheral tissue. When the body no is longer able to maintain systemic pressure and flow, a decreased heart rate leads to the initiation of decompensatory shock.",1,C
44,15469601,"This review addresses the pathophysiology and treatment of hemorrhagic shock - a condition produced by rapid and significant loss of intravascular volume, which may lead sequentially to hemodynamic instability, decreases in oxygen delivery, decreased tissue perfusion, cellular hypoxia, organ damage, and death.

44,29262047,"Etiology: Though most commonly thought of in the setting of trauma, there are numerous causes of hemorrhagic shock that span many systems. Blunt or penetrating trauma is the most common cause, followed by upper and lower gastrointestinal sources. Obstetrical, vascular, iatrogenic, and even urological sources have all been described. Bleeding may be either external or internal. A substantial amount of blood loss to the point of hemodynamic compromise may occur in the chest, abdomen, or retroperitoneum. The thigh itself can hold up to 1 L to 2 L of blood. Pathophysiology: Hemorrhagic shock is due to the depletion of intravascular volume through blood loss to the point of being unable to match the tissues demand for oxygen. As a result, mitochondria are no longer able to sustain aerobic metabolism for the production of oxygen and switch to the less efficient anaerobic metabolism to meet the cellular demand for adenosine triphosphate. In the latter process, pyruvate is produced and converted to lactic acid to regenerate nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) to maintain some degree of cellular respiration in the absence of oxygen. The body compensates for volume loss by increasing heart rate and contractility, followed by baroreceptor activation resulting in sympathetic nervous system activation and peripheral vasoconstriction. Typically, there is a slight increase in the diastolic blood pressure with narrowing of the pulse pressure. As diastolic ventricular filling continues to decline and cardiac output decreases, systolic blood pressure drops. Due to sympathetic nervous system activation, blood is diverted away from noncritical organs and tissues to preserve blood supply to vital organs such as the heart and brain. While prolonging heart and brain function, this also leads to other tissues being further deprived of oxygen causing more lactic acid production and worsening acidosis. This worsening acidosis along with hypoxemia, if left uncorrected, eventually causes the loss of peripheral vasoconstriction, worsening hemodynamic compromise, and death. The body’s compensation varies by cardiopulmonary comorbidities, age, and vasoactive medications. Due to these factors, heart rate and blood pressure responses are extremely variable and, therefore, cannot be relied upon as the sole means of diagnosis.","Though most found in trauma cases, there are numerous causes of hemorrhagic (excessive bleeding) shock stemming from various organ systems. Blunt or penetrating trauma (injury) is the most common cause. Additional causes include upper and lower gastrointestinal (stomach) sources. Obstetrical (related to childbirth), vascular (related to blood vessels), iatrogenic (illness caused by medical exams), and even urological (related to the urinary tract) sources have all been described. Bleeding may be either external or internal. A substantial amount of blood loss, to the point of dysregulated (incorrect) blood flow, may occur in the chest, abdomen, or in the retroperitoneum. The retroperitoneum is area in the back of the abdomen not covered by the peritoneum. The thigh can hold up to 1 L to 2 L of blood. Hemorrhagic shock is caused by the blood loss in vessels to the point of being unable to match the tissues demand for oxygen. As a result, mitochondria (cell part responsible for making chemical energy) are unable to sustain metabolisms needed for oxygen production. Mitochondria switch to the less efficient metabolism to meet cell demand. Pyruvate, a chemical product of energy production, is produced and converted to maintain some cellular respiration (energy creation) in the absence of oxygen. The body compensates for volume loss by increasing heart rate and contractions. These alterations are followed by baroreceptor activation, which is the increased activity of receptors to regulate blood pressure. The resulting endpoints are sympathetic nervous system activation (fight-or-flight activation) and constriction of blood vessels. The sympathetic nervous system is responsible for heart rate, blood pressure, breathing rate, and pupil size. There is normally a slight increase in the diastolic blood pressure (when the heart is relaxed) with decreased pulse pressure. As the rate in which the heart fills with blood declines and cardiac output decreases, systolic blood pressure (heart is contracting) drops. Due to sympathetic nervous system activation, blood is moved away from noncritical organs and tissues. This is done to preserve blood supply to vital organs like the heart and brain. While prolonging heart and brain function, this blood movement leads to other tissues being deprived of oxygen. This deprivation can cause more lactic acid production and a build up of acid in the blood. This acid build up along with low blood oxygen, if left uncorrected, eventually causes the loss of peripheral vasoconstriction (narrowed blood vessels), decreased blood flow, and death. How the body handles this varies by accompanying heart and lung diseases, age, and blood pressure medications. Due to these factors, heart rate and blood pressure responses are extremely different between patients. Therefore, heart rate and blood pressure cannot be the sole reasons of diagnosis.",1,C
44,31030706,"Introduction: Hemorrhage is the leading cause of preventable death in combat, although early recognition of hemorrhage is still challenging on the battlefield. Hypothesis/Problem: The objective of this study was to describe the shock index (SI) in a healthy military population, and to measure its variation during a controlled blood loss, simulated by blood donation. Methods: A prospective observational study that enrolled military subjects, volunteers for blood donation, was conducted. Demographic and clinical information, concerning both the patient and the blood collection, were recorded. Baseline vital signs were measured, before and after donation, in a 45° supine position. Statistical analysis was performed after calculation of SI. Results: A total of 483 participants were included in the study. The mean blood donation volume was 473mL (SD = 44mL). The median pre- and post-blood donation SI were significantly different: 0.54 (IQR = 0.48-0.63) and 0.57 (IQR = 0.49-0.66), respectively (P = .002). Changes in pre-/post-donation blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) also reached statistical difference but represented a clinically poor relevance. The multivariate analysis showed no significant associations between SI variations and age, sex, body mass index (BMI), sport activities, blood donation volume, and enteral volume replacement (EVR). Conclusion: In this model of mild hemorrhage, SI exhibited significant variations but failed to reach clinical relevance. Further studies are needed to prove the benefit of SI calculation as a possible parameter for early recognition of hemorrhage in combat casualties at the point of injury.","Hemorrhage (excessive bleeding) is the leading cause of preventable death in combat.

Consequently, more than 90% of all trauma patients could not be classified according to the ATLS(®) classification of hypovolaemic shock.

Also, the area of the wounds was estimated by multiplying width by length. In total, 83 patients in each group completed the study. The groups were matched for starting severity and size of PUs. Average decrease in the severity of PU in the nifedipine group was higher than the dummy treatment group on day 7 and day 14. Also, the average decrease in the area of PU was higher in the nifedipine group compared with the sham treatment group on day 7 and 14 of the study. Skin-level application of nifedipine 3% ointment for 14 days improved the healing process of mild or moderate PUs in very ill patients.",2,C
45,31237193,"Chronic wounds unresponsive to existing treatments constitute a serious disease burden. Factors that contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic ulcers include oxidative stress, comorbid microbial infections, and the type of immune system response. Preclinically, and in a case study, a formulation containing a Ceratothoa oestroides olive oil extract promoted wound healing. Patients with chronic venous and pressure ulcers, clinically assessed as being unresponsive to healing agents, were treated for 3 months with an ointment containing the C oestroides extract combined with antibiotic and/or antiseptic agents chosen according to the type of bacterial infection. Treatment evaluation was performed using the Bates-Jensen criteria with +WoundDesk and MOWA cell phone applications. After 3 months of treatment, C oestroides resulted in an average decrease of 36% in the Bates-Jensen score of ulcers (P < .000), with the decrease being significant from the first month (P < .007). The combined use of topically applied antibiotics and antiseptics efficiently controlled microbial ulcer infection and facilitated wound healing. In relation to other factors such as initial wound size, chronicity appeared to be an important prognostic factor regarding the extent of wound healing. Future clinical investigations assessing the wound healing efficacy of the C oestroides olive oil extract are warranted.","Long-lasting wounds that do not respond to available treatments have serious impacts. Things that determine how bedsores progress include low antioxidant levels, other infections caused by microbes (microorganisms), and the type of immune system response. Before symptoms, and in a detailed study, a mixture containing a Ceratothoa oestroides (fish parasite) olive oil extract increased wound healing. Patients with long-lasting leg ulcers (sores) due to blood flow problems and bedsores, determined by doctors as not responding to healing treatments, were treated for 3 months with an ointment with C oestroides extract combined with antibiotics (kill bacteria) and/or antiseptics (slow bacteria growth) based on type of bacterial infection. We evaluated treatment using a common tool used to track wound healing with two cell phone apps. After 3 months of treatment, C oestroides caused an average score decrease of 36% on a common tool used to track wound healing. Applying both antibiotics and antiseptics controlled ulcer infection by microorganisms and helped wound healing. Compared to things like initial wound size, how long lasting the wound was seemed to be an important factor in predicting how much the wound healed. Future studies looking at how well C oestroides olive oil extract works to heal wounds are needed.",1,C
45,30767645,"Products that provide a protective skin barrier play a vital role in defending the skin against the corrosive effect of bodily fluids, including wound exudate, urine, liquid faeces, stoma output and sweat. There are many products to choose from, which can be broadly categorised by ingredients. This article describes the differences in mechanisms of action between barrier products comprising petrolatum and/or zinc oxide, silicone film-forming polymers and cyanoacrylates, and compares the evidence on them. The literature indicates that all types of barrier product are clinically effective, with little comparative evidence indicating that any one ingredient is more efficacious than another, although film-forming polymers and cyanoacrylates have been found to be easier to apply and more cost-effective. However, laboratory evidence, albeit limited, indicates that a concentrated cyanoacrylate produced a more substantial and adherent layer on a porcine explant when compared with a diluted cyanoacrylate and was more effective at protecting skin from abrasion and repeated exposure to moisture than a film-forming polymer. Finally, a silicone-based cream containing micronutrients was found to significantly reduce the incidence of pressure ulceration when used as part of a comprehensive prevention strategy.","Products that serve as a barrier to protect the skin are important in defending the skin against chemically damaging effects of bodily fluids, including fluid produced from the healing process, urine, liquid faeces, output from an opening in the body and sweat. Many treatments exist, which can be grouped based on ingredients. This study describes the differences in how barrier products work, including petroleum jelly (Vaseline) and/or zinc oxide, polymers (substances made of very large molecules) that form silicone (type of polymer) film, and cyanoacrylates (group of strong fast-acting adhesives). Studies suggest all barrier products work, with few studies that compare ingredients to show one works better than another. Film-forming polymers and cyanoacrylates are easier to apply and cost less. Limited lab data suggest that a concentrated cyanoacrylate made a more notable layer that stuck more to pig tissue than a less-concentrated cyanoacrylate and protected the skin from rubbing and moisture better than a film-forming polymer. Finally, a silicon-based cream with vitamins and minerals needed by the body in very small amounts significantly reduced bedsore occurrence when used with other approaches.",1,C

Method: In this randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, patients with category I or II PUs were randomly assigned to receive either topical PTX 5% or a placebo twice daily for 14 days. Changes in PU characteristics (category and size) were assessed. The category of the PU was determined by the Stirling Pressure Ulcer Severity Scale (two-digit) at baseline (day zero), day seven and day 14 of treatment. PU length and width was measured with a disposable ruler and expressed as cm2. Results: A total of 112 adult patients were enrolled in the study. Median PU size and score at day zero were 32 (10.00-69.33)cm2 and 1(1.00-2.00) respectively. In the PTX group, the mean differences (95% confidence interval, CI) of all PU scores and sizes decreased significantly across the intervals (day seven versus day zero, day 14 versus day zero, and day 14 versus day seven), compared with the placebo group Conclusion: The severity and size of PUs improved significantly in patients who received topical PTX 5% ointment twice a day for 14 days compared with those in the placebo group.

45,29295637,"Aims: To describe the utilization of clostridial collagenase ointment (CCO) and medicinal honey debridement methods in real-world inpatient and outpatient hospital settings among pressure ulcer (PU) patients and compare the frequency of healthcare re-encounters between CCO- and medicinal honey-treated patients. Materials and methods: De-identified hospital discharge records for patients receiving CCO or medicinal honey methods of debridement and having an ICD-9 code for PU were extracted from the US Premier Healthcare Database. Multivariable analysis was used to compare the frequency of inpatient and outpatient revisits up to 6 months after an index encounter for CCO- vs medicinal honey-treated PUs. Results: The study identified 48,267 inpatients and 2,599 outpatients with PUs treated with CCO or medicinal honeys. Among study inpatients, n = 44,725 (93%) were treated with CCO, and n = 3,542 (7%) with medicinal honeys. CCO and medicinal honeys accounted for 1,826 (70%) and 773 (30%), respectively, of study outpatients. In adjusted models, those treated with CCO had lower odds for inpatient readmissions (OR = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.80-0.94) after inpatient index visits, and outpatient re-encounters both after inpatient (OR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.67-0.79) and outpatient (OR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.64-0.95) index visits in 6 months of follow-up. Limitations: The study was observational in nature, and did not adjust for reasons why patients were hospitalized initially, or why they returned to the facility. Although the study adjusted for differences in a variety of demographic, clinical, and hospital characteristics between the treatments, we are not able to rule out selection bias. Conclusion: Patients with CCO-treated PUs returned to inpatient and outpatient hospital settings less often compared with medicinal honey-treated PUs. These results from real-world administrative data help to gain a better understanding of the clinical characteristics of patients with PUs treated with these two debridement methods and the economic implications of debridement choice in the acute care setting.","We aim to describe the use of clostridial collagenase ointment (CCO - a medication with special proteins) and medical honey to remove damaged tissue in hospitals among bedsore patients and compare how often CCO- and medical honey-treated patients return to the hospital. We obtained hospital discharge records from a national database for patients getting CCO or medical honey methods of removing damaged tissues with an official diagnosis of bedsores. We used statistical models to compare how often patients who did and did not stay at least one night in the hospital returned to the hospital up to 6 months after bedsore treatment with either CCO or medical honey. We looked at 48,267 and 2,599 patients with bedsores treated with CCO or medicine honeys who did and did not stay at least one night at the hospital, respectively. CCO and medical honeys made up 44,725 (93%) and 3,542 (7%), respectively, of people who stayed at least one night in the hospital. CCO and medical honeys made up 1,826 (70%) and 773 (30%), respectively, of people who did not stay a night in the hospital. Based on models, patients treated with CCO were less likely to be readmitted to the hospital after being admitted, and to return to the hospital but not stay a night after either going to the hospital and staying or not staying at least one night over the following 6 months. Study limitations included not considering why patients were hospitalized or why they returned to the hospital. Even though we took into account differences in many population, clinical, and hospital characteristics between the treatments, the study population may have not been completely random. We conclude that bedsore patients treated with CCO returned to the hospital less often than those treated with medical honey. These results based on real-world data help us better understand treatment characteristics of bedsore patients related with these two days to remove damaged tissue and connect to method costs related to short-term care.",1,C

The present study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of MEBO in the treatment of pressure ulcers in Chinese patients. Methods: Seventy-two patients with pressure ulcers were randomly assigned to 2 groups who received a placebo or MEBO for 2 months. The primary outcomes included the wound surface area (WSA) and pressure ulcer scale for healing (PUSH) tool. The secondary outcomes included a visual analog scale (VAS), questionnaire of ulcer status, and adverse effects. Results: Sixty-seven patients completed the study.

45,28639707,"Background: Pressure ulcers, also known as bedsores, decubitus ulcers and pressure injuries, are localised areas of injury to the skin or the underlying tissue, or both. Dressings are widely used to treat pressure ulcers and promote healing, and there are many options to choose from including alginate, hydrocolloid and protease-modulating dressings. Topical agents have also been used as alternatives to dressings in order to promote healing. A clear and current overview of all the evidence is required to facilitate decision-making regarding the use of dressings or topical agents for the treatment of pressure ulcers. Such a review would ideally help people with pressure ulcers and health professionals assess the best treatment options. This review is a network meta-analysis (NMA) which assesses the probability of complete ulcer healing associated with alternative dressings and topical agents. Main results: We included 51 studies (2947 participants) in this review and carried out NMA in a network of linked interventions for the sole outcome of probability of complete healing. The network included 21 different interventions (13 dressings, 6 topical agents and 2 supplementary linking interventions) and was informed by 39 studies in 2127 participants, of whom 783 had completely healed wounds. We judged the network to be sparse: overall, there were relatively few participants, with few events, both for the number of interventions and the number of mixed treatment contrasts; most studies were small or very small. The consequence of this sparseness is high imprecision in the evidence, and this, coupled with the (mainly) high risk of bias in the studies informing the network, means that we judged the vast majority of the evidence to be of low or very low certainty. We have no confidence in the findings regarding the rank order of interventions in this review (very low-certainty evidence), but we report here a summary of results for some comparisons of interventions compared with saline gauze. We present here only the findings from evidence which we did not consider to be very low certainty, but these reported results should still be interpreted in the context of the very low certainty of the network as a whole. It is not clear whether regimens involving protease-modulating dressings increase the probability of pressure ulcer healing compared with saline gauze (risk ratio (RR) 1.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.92 to 2.94) (moderate-certainty evidence: low risk of bias, downgraded for imprecision). This risk ratio of 1.65 corresponds to an absolute difference of 102 more people healed with protease modulating dressings per 1000 people treated than with saline gauze alone (95% CI 13 fewer to 302 more). It is unclear whether the following interventions increase the probability of healing compared with saline gauze (low-certainty evidence): collagenase ointment (RR 2.12, 95% CI 1.06 to 4.22); foam dressings (RR 1.52, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.26); basic wound contact dressings (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.65 to 2.58) and polyvinylpyrrolidone plus zinc oxide (RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.37 to 4.62); the latter two interventions both had confidence intervals consistent with both a clinically important benefit and a clinically important harm, and the former two interventions each had high risk of bias as well as imprecision. Authors' conclusions: A network meta-analysis (NMA) of data from 39 studies (evaluating 21 dressings and topical agents for pressure ulcers) is sparse and the evidence is of low or very low certainty (due mainly to risk of bias and imprecision). Consequently we are unable to determine which dressings or topical agents are the most likely to heal pressure ulcers, and it is generally unclear whether the treatments examined are more effective than saline gauze. More research is needed to determine whether particular dressings or topical agents improve the probability of healing of pressure ulcers. The NMA is uninformative regarding which interventions might best be included in a large trial, and it may be that research is directed towards prevention, leaving clinicians to decide which treatment to use on the basis of wound symptoms, clinical experience, patient preference and cost.","Bedsores are areas of injury to the skin or underlying tissue, or both, found in a certain part of the body.

We are not sure our ranking of interventions (treatments) is correct, but we summarize our results to compare treatments to saline gauze often used to as a wound dressing. We report only results from data we did not think was low quality, but these reported results should be considered keeping in mind the overall low certainty of data used. We are not sure whether protease-modulating (protein-altering) dressings increased the likelihood of bedsore healing compared to saline gauze.

45,34692658,"Pressure ulcer (PU) is a worldwide problem that is hard to heal because of its prolonged inflammatory response and impaired ECM deposition caused by local hypoxia and repeated ischemia/reperfusion. Our previous study discovered that the non-fouling zwitterionic sulfated poly (sulfobetaine methacrylate) (SBMA) hydrogel can improve PU healing with rapid ECM rebuilding. However, the mechanism of the SBMA hydrogel in promoting ECM rebuilding is unclear. Therefore, in this work, the impact of the SBMA hydrogel on ECM reconstruction is comprehensively studied, and the underlying mechanism is intensively investigated in a rat PU model. The in vivo data demonstrate that compared to the PEG hydrogel, the SBMA hydrogel enhances the ECM remolding by the upregulation of fibronectin and laminin expression as well as the inhibition of MMP-2. Further investigation reveals that the decreased MMP-2 expression of zwitterionic SBMA hydrogel treatment is due to the activation of autophagy through the inhibited PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway and reduced inflammation. The association of autophagy with ECM remodeling may provide a way in guiding the design of biomaterial-based wound dressing for chronic wound repair.","Bedsores are a worldwide problem that is hard to heal because it causes long-lasting inflammation (redness and swelling from fighting an infection) and harms the extracellular matrix (ECM; secreted by cells and surrounds cells in tissues) from not enough oxygen and blood flow. The study we did before found that non-fouling zwitterionic (inner salts to which proteins and bacteria cannot stick) sulfated poly (sulfobetaine methacrylate) (SBMA) hydrogel can improve bedsore healing and quickly rebuild ECM. However, scientists are unsure how SBMA hydrogel rebuilds ECM. In this study, we look at how SBMA hydrogel rebuilds ECM using a rat bedsore model. SMBA hydrogel helps remodel ECM better than PEG hydrogel, another bedsore treatment. The relationship between autophagy (cleaning out of damaged cells) with ECM remodeling may influence the design of wound dressings with substances that interact with biological systems for long-term wound repair.",1,C

In many cases, it is difficult to cure a pressure ulcer, especially when it is deep and extensive, and prognosis is usually unfavourable. Treatment of decubitus ulcers requires new specialist dressings, which play an important role in the healing process. Aim: To evaluate therapeutic efficacy of active specialist medical dressings in the treatment of decubitus. Material and methods: Research involved 40 patients - 18 (45%) women and 22 (55%) men, suffering from decubitus ulcers of different size and depth, localized in the sacral region, lasting from 1.5 to 30 months. Patients were randomly assigned to two research groups (20 people each), were treated for 4 weeks with 2 different specialist dressings. ATRAUMAN Ag, which contains silver ions, was used in the first group, while paraffin gauze of BACTIGRAS type was used in the second group. An assessment of pressure ulcers' healing progress was done with a planimetric method, which evaluates the wound surface area. Results: The analysis results showed a significant statistical decrease in an average decubitus ulcer surface area in both research groups: in the first group by 60.2% (p = 0.001), and in the second group by 32.95% (p < 0.001), which speaks in favour of dressings with silver ions as having better therapeutic effectiveness.

47,34711245,"Background: Tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP) encoded by the ALPL gene is of particular importance for bone mineralization. Mutation in the ALPL gene can lead to persistent low ALP activity resulting in the rare disease Hypophosphatasia (HPP) that is characterized by disturbed bone and dental mineralization. While severe forms are extremely rare with an estimated prevalence of 1/100.000, recent studies suggest that moderate form caused by heterozygous mutations are much more frequent with an estimated prevalence of 1/508. The purpose of this study was to estimate the prevalence of low AP levels in the population based on laboratory measurements. Methods: In this study, the prevalence of low AP activity and elevated pyridoxal-5-phosphate (PLP) levels was analyzed in 6.918.126 measurements from 2011 to 2016 at a single laboratory in northern Germany. Only laboratory values of subjects older than 18 years of age were included. Only the first measurement was included, all repeated values were excluded. Results: In total, 8.46% of the measurements of a total of 6.918.126 values showed a value < 30 U/L. 0.59% of the subjects with an ALP activity below 30 U/L had an additional PLP measurement. Here, 6.09% showed elevated pyridoxal-5-phosphate (PLP) levels. This suggest that 0.52% (1:194) of subjects show laboratory signs of HPP. Conclusion: These data support the genetic estimation that the prevalence of moderate forms of HPP may be significantly higher than expected.

47,34515659,"Summary: Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is a rare and under-recognised genetic defect in bone mineralisation. Patients presenting with fragility fractures may be mistakenly diagnosed as having osteoporosis and prescribed antiresorptive therapy, a treatment which may increase fracture risk. Adult-onset HPPhypophosphatasia was identified in a 40-year-old woman who presented with bilateral atypical femoral fractures after 4 years of denosumab therapy. A low serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and increased serum vitamin B6 level signalled the diagnosis, which was later confirmed by identification of two recessive mutations of the ALPL gene. The patient was treated with teriparatide given the unavailability of ALP enzyme-replacement therapy (asfotase alfa). Fracture healing occurred, but impaired mobility persisted. HPP predisposes to atypical femoral fracture (AFF) during antiresorptive therapy; hence, bisphosphonates and denosumab are contraindicated in this condition. Screening patients with fracture or 'osteoporosis' to identify a low ALP level is recommended. Learning points: Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is a rare and under-recognised cause of bone fragility produced by impaired matrix mineralisation that can be misdiagnosed as a fragility fracture due to age-related bone loss. Antiresorptive therapy is contraindicated in HPP. Low serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) provides a clue to the diagnosis. Elevated serum vitamin B6 (an ALP substrate) is indicative of HPP, while identification of a mutation in the ALPL gene is confirmatory. Enzyme therapy with recombinant ALP (asfotase alfa) is currently prohibitively costly. Treatment with anabolic bone agents such as teriparatide has been reported, but whether normally mineralized bone is formed requires further study.","Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is a rare and under-recognized genetic defect in bone mineralization. Bone mineralization is when bone become calcified. Patients presenting with fragility fractures may be mistakenly diagnosed as having osteoporosis (brittle bones). These patients may be prescribed antiresorptive therapy, or drugs that block the breakdown of bone. These drugs may increase fracture risk. Adult-onset HPP was identified in a 40-year-old woman. She had with femur fractures after 4 years of using denosumba, a drug to treat osteoporosis. A low serum (blood) alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and increased serum vitamin B6 level signaled the diagnosis. Her diagnosis of HPP was later confirmed by identification of two recessive gene mutations of the ALPL gene. ALP is an enzyme that helps bone strength. ALPL is the gene that encodes ALP. The patient was treated with teriparatide (an osteoporosis drug) due to the unavailability of ALP enzyme-replacement therapy. The fractures healed. However, her mobility was impaired. HPP makes someone more likely to experience femur fractures during antiresorptive therapy. Because of this, bisphosphonates (drugs that limit bone density) and denosumab should not be given to people with this condition. Healthcare workings should screen patients with fracture or 'osteoporosis' to identify a low ALP level. HPP is a rare and under-recognized cause of bone fragility. HPP is caused by impaired mineralization that can be misdiagnosed as a fragility fracture due to age-related bone loss. Antiresorptive therapy is not recommended in HPP treatment. Low serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) can aid in diagnosis. Elevated serum vitamin B6 (a chemical that works with ALP) is suggestive of HPP. Identifying mutations within the ALPL gene can confirm HPP status. Therapy with a chemical ALP reacts with, known as asfotase alfa, is currently unmanageably expensive. Treatment with anabolic (repairing) bone agents has been reported. However, if this treatment helps normally mineralized bone form needs further study.",1,B
47,34547524,"Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is the heritable dento-osseous disease caused by loss-of-function mutation(s) of the gene ALPL that encodes the tissue-nonspecific isoenzyme of alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP). TNSALP is a cell-surface homodimeric phosphomonoester phosphohydrolase expressed in healthy people especially in the skeleton, liver, kidneys, and developing teeth. In HPP, diminished TNSALP activity leads to extracellular accumulation of its natural substrates including inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi), an inhibitor of mineralization, and pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP), the principal circulating form of vitamin B6 (B6). Autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive inheritance involving >450 usually missense defects scattered throughout ALPL largely explains the remarkably broad-ranging severity of this inborn-error-of-metabolism. In 1985 when we identified elevated plasma PLP as a biochemical hallmark of HPP, all 14 investigated affected children and adults had markedly increased PLP levels. However, pyridoxal (PL), the dephosphorylated form of PLP that enters cells to cofactor many enzymatic reactions, was not low but often inexplicably elevated. Levels of pyridoxic acid (PA), the B6 degradation product quantified to assess B6 sufficiency, were unremarkable. Canonical signs or symptoms of B6 deficiency or toxicity were absent. B6-dependent seizures in infants with life-threatening HPP were later explained by their profound deficiency of TNSALP activity blocking PLP dephosphorylation to PL and diminishing gamma-aminobutyric acid synthesis in the brain. Now, there is speculation that altered B6 metabolism causes further clinical complications in HPP. Herein, we assessed the plasma PL and PA levels accompanying previously reported elevated plasma PLP concentrations in 150 children and adolescents with HPP. Their mean (SD) plasma PL level was nearly double the mean for our healthy pediatric controls: 66.7 (59.0) nM versus 37.1 (22.2) nM (P < 0.0001), respectively. Their PA levels were broader than our pediatric control range, but their mean value was normal; 40.2 (25.1) nM versus 39.3 (9.9) nM (P = 0.7793), respectively. In contrast, adults with HPP often had plasma PL and PA levels suggestive of dietary B6 insufficiency. We discuss why the B6 levels of our pediatric patients with HPP would not cause B6 toxicity or deficiency, whereas in affected adults dietary B6 insufficiency can develop.","Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is the heritable, tooth and bone disease.

The study aimed to investigate the amount of ALPL variants and physical and biochemical markers among adults with hormonal diagnoses and persistant low ALP levels. We reviewed a database of ALP measurements from 26,121 individuals to identify adults over 18 years with persistently low levels of ALP. ALPL gene testing, biological tests, and assessment of symptoms by a questionnaire among included patients were performed. Among 24 patients, thirteen (54.2%) had a disease-causing variant in ALPL and mild symptoms of HPP, of which musculoskeletal pain was the most frequent. A specific gene mutation that altered a protein segment was found in six subjects. A similar gene mutation and deletion of a gene segment was detected by genetic tests. Tests showed no differences in ALP, bone-specific ALP, and pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) or active vitamin B6 between patients with an ALPL mutation and no genetic diseases. Patients with an ALPL mutation had much higher PLP levels than healthy patients. We saw normal ALP activity in some patients with mild HPP. We also saw slightly increased PLP in two subjects with no gene diseases and four healthy patients. Among 51 with persistent low ALP levels, fifteen (29.4%) had anti-bone-breakdown treatment. Two patients with unrecognized HPP were treated with anti-bone-breakdown drugs and did not show side effects from treatment. Disease-causing mutations in ALPL are common in patients with hormonal diagnoses and low ALP. Regarding detection, gene testing is needed to identify mild HPP due to diverse biochemical findings. Anti-bone-breakdown treatment is frequent reason for low ALP levels and treatment effects in adults with an ALPL mutation and bone breakdown remain unclear and need further studies.",2,B
47,34233724,"Background: Severe hypercalcemia is rare in newborns; even though often asymptomatic, it may have important sequelae. Hypophosphatemia can occur in infants experiencing intrauterine malnutrition, sepsis and early high-energy parenteral nutrition (PN) and can cause severe hypercalcemia through an unknown mechanism. Monitoring and supplementation of phosphate (PO4) and calcium (Ca) in the first week of life in preterm infants are still debated. Case presentation: We report on a female baby born at 29 weeks' gestation with intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) experiencing sustained severe hypercalcemia (up to 24 mg/dl corrected Ca) due to hypophosphatemia while on phosphorus-free PN. Hypercalcemia did not improve after hyperhydration and furosemide but responded to infusion of PO4. Eventually, the infant experienced symptomatic hypocalcaemia (ionized Ca 3.4 mg/dl), likely exacerbated by contemporary infusion of albumin. Subsequently, a normalization of both parathyroid hormone (PTH) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was observed. Conclusions: Although severe hypercalcemia is extremely rare in neonates, clinicians should be aware of the possible occurrence of this life-threatening condition in infants with or at risk to develop hypophosphatemia. Hypophosphatemic hypercalcemia can only be managed with infusion of PO4, with strict monitoring of Ca and PO4 concentrations.","Severe hypercalcemia, or too high calcium blood levels, is rare in newborns. Even though hypercalcemia often shows no symptoms, it may have important effects on overall health. Hypophosphatemia is when the body has low levels of phosphorous. Hypophosphatemia can occur in infants experiencing malnutrition while in the womb, blood infection, and early high-energy parenteral nutrition (PN). PN is when a mother is given nutrients through IV. Hypophosphatemia can cause severe hypercalcemia through an unknown mechanism. It is debated if phosphate (PO4) and calcium (Ca) should be given in the first week of life in preterm infants. This study reports on a female baby born at 29 weeks' gestation (time in womb). The infant had intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) and long-term severe hypercalcemia due to hypophosphatemia while on phosphorus-free PN. IUGR is when a baby does not grow to normal weight during pregnancy. Hypercalcemia did not improve after excess water intake but responded to infusion of PO4. Eventually, the infant experienced symptoms of hypocalcemia. This was likely worsened by infusion of albumin, a blood protein. Following this, parathyroid hormone (PTH), which controls calcium and phosphorus in the blood, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), which removes phosphate groups, returned to normal levels. Severe hypercalcemia is extremely rare in newborns. However, doctors should be aware of the possible occurrence of this life-threatening condition in infants with or at risk to develop hypophosphatemia. Hypophosphatemic hypercalcemia can only be managed with infusion of PO4, with strict monitoring of Ca and PO4 concentrations.",1,B
47,34213743,"Purpose: The study aimed to define the clinical, biochemical and genetic features of adult patients with osteopenia/osteoporosis and/or bone fragility and low serum alkaline phosphatase (sALP). Methods: Twenty-two patients with at least two sALP values below the reference range were retrospectively enrolled after exclusion of secondary causes. Data about clinical features, mineral and bone markers, serum pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP), urine phosphoethanolamine (PEA), lumbar and femur bone densitometry, and column X-ray were collected. Peripheral blood DNA of each participant was analyzed to detect ALPL gene anomalies. Results: Pathogenic ALPL variants (pALPL) occurred in 23% and benign variants in 36% of patients (bALPL), while nine patients harbored wild-type alleles (wtALPL). Fragility fractures and dental anomalies were more frequent in patients harboring pALPL and bALPL than in wtALPL patients. Of note, wtALPL patients comprised women treated with tamoxifen for hormone-sensitive breast cancer. Mineral and bone markers were similar in the three groups. Mean urine PEA levels were significantly higher in patients harboring pALPL than those detected in patients harboring bALPL and wtALPL; by contrast, serum PLP levels were similar in the three groups. A 6-points score, considering clinical and biochemical features, was predictive of pALPL detection [P = 0.060, OR 1.92 (95% CI 0.972, 3.794)], and more significantly of pALPL or bALPL [P = 0.025, OR 14.33 (95% CI 1.401, 14.605)]. Conclusion: In osteopenic/osteoporotic patients, single clinical or biochemical factors did not distinguish hypophosphatasemic patients harboring pALPL or bALPL from those harboring wtALPL. Occurrence of multiple clinical and biochemical features is predictive of ALPL anomalies, and, therefore, they should be carefully identified. Tamoxifen emerged as a hypophosphatasemic drug.","The study aimed to define the health, biochemical, and genetic features of adult patients with bone strength issues and low serum (blood) alkaline phosphatase (sALP), a protein that helps bone strength. Twenty-two patients with at least two sALP measurements below the desired range were enrolled. Any patients with additional disease or health complications were excluded. Several data points for patient health and biological indicators of disease status were collected. Patient DNA was analyzed to detect ALPL gene anomalies. Several types of mutations within the ALPL gene were found amongst the participant population. These variants include pathogenic (harmful) ALPL variants (pALPL), benign (harmless) variants (bALPL), and wild-type (normal) variants (wtALPL). pALPL are variants that increases a person's chance to get sick from a disease. bALPL are mutations that do not impact human health. wtALPL variants are genes that are not mutated or changed in form. Bone and tooth damage were more frequent in patients harboring pALPL and bALPL than in wtALPL patients. Of note, wtALPL patients comprised women treated with tamoxifen, a drug for breast cancer. Mineral and bone markers were similar in the three groups. Average urine phosphoethanolamine, a compound that can indicate bone disease, was significantly higher in patients with pALPL than the other two variant types. By contrast, serum pyridoxal-5'-phosphate, an indicator of vitamin B6 volume, was similar in the three groups. Certain hospital evaluation techniques were able to predict pALPL and bALPL. In patients with osteoporosis (brittle bones), visible health effects and biological compound indicators do not distinguish hypophosphatasemia (low serum ALP) patients harboring pALPL or bALPL variants from those harboring wtALPL. However, visible health effects and biological compound indicators can be predictive of ALPL anomalies. Therefore, they should be carefully identified.

Autosomal recessive or autosomal dominant inheritance from among >300 TNSALP (ALPL) mutations largely explains HPP's remarkably broad-ranging severity. TNSALP is a cell-surface homodimeric phosphohydrolase richly expressed in the skeleton, liver, kidney, and developing teeth. In HPP, TNSALP substrates accumulate extracellularly. Among them is inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi), a potent inhibitor of mineralization. Superabundance of extracellular PPi explains the hard tissue complications of HPP that feature premature loss of deciduous teeth and often rickets or osteomalacia as well as calcific arthropathies in some affected adults. In infants with severe HPP, blocked entry of minerals into the skeleton can cause hypercalcemia, and insufficient hydrolysis of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP), the major circulating form of vitamin B6, can cause pyridoxine-dependent seizures. Elevated circulating PLP is a sensitive and specific biochemical marker for HPP. Also, the TNSALP substrate phosphoethanolamine (PEA) is usually elevated in serum and urine in HPP, though less reliably for diagnosis. Pathognomonic radiographic changes occur in pediatric HPP when the skeletal disease is severe.

HPP features low serum (blood) alkaline phosphatase (ALP - a protein which indicates bone health) activity (hypophosphatasemia). This is caused by mutation(s) of the gene that encodes the tissue-nonspecific isoenzyme (form) of ALP (TNSALP). This mutation renders the gene unable to complete it function. Variations in the type of mutations largely explains HPP's remarkably broad-ranging severity. TNSALP is an enzyme expressed in the skeleton, liver, kidney, and developing teeth. In HPP, TNSALP substrates (proteins altered by TNSALP) accumulate outside of cells. One substrate is inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi), a potent inhibitor (blocker) of mineralization. Superabundance of extracellular PPi explains the hard tissue complications of HPP. These complications include premature loss of deciduous teeth, rickets or bone softening, and joint swelling in some affected adults. In infants with severe HPP, blocked entry of minerals into the skeleton can cause hypercalcemia (high calcium levels). Additionally, insufficient breakdown of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP), the major circulating form of vitamin B6, can cause seizures.

Lipedema can progress to include lipo-lymphedema of the ankles and feet. This report is of a 41-year old woman with Stage 3 lipedema and lipo-lymphedema with excessive fat of the lower body since puberty, with progression to swollen ankles and feet despite dietary caloric restriction. CASE REPORT A 41-year-old woman noticed increased fat in her legs since age 12. Her weight and leg size increased until age 21, when she reached a maximum weight of 165 kg, and underwent a Roux-En-Y gastric bypass. Over 12 months, she lost 74.8 kg. Her trunk significantly reduced in weight, but her legs did not. Fifteen years later, during recovery from hysterectomy surgery, she became progressively weaker and swollen over her entire body. Laboratory test results showed hypoalbuminemia (2.0 g/dL), lymphopenia, and hypolipoproteinemia. She was diagnosed with protein and calorie malnutrition with marked gut edema requiring prolonged parenteral nutrition. After restoration of normal protein, her health returned and her pitting edema resolved, but her extremities remained enlarged. She was subsequently diagnosed with lipedema. CONCLUSIONS This report demonstrates that early and correct diagnosis of lipedema is important, as women who believe the condition is due to obesity may suffer the consequences of calorie or protein-calorie deficiency in an attempt to lose weight.","Lipedema is a common condition where there is too much fat in the arms and legs and is found mainly in women, usually occurring after puberty (when a child's body changes to become an adult) or pregnancy.

This report is of a 41-year old woman with Stage 3 lipedema and lipo-lymphedema with excessive fat of the lower body since puberty. The woman's condition has advanced to swollen ankles and feet despite being on a low calorie diet. The 41-year-old woman noticed increased fat in her legs since age 12. Her weight and leg size increased until age 21, when she reached a maximum weight of 364 pounds (165 kg), and had a procedure called gastric bypass that involves a doctor placing a small pouch in the stomach and food only goes into that pouch. Over 12 months, she lost 165 pounds (74.8 kg). Her trunk (chest, stomach, and back) significantly reduced in weight, but her legs did not. Fifteen years later, during recovery from surgery, she became continuously weaker and swollen over her entire body. Lab test results showed hypoalbuminemia (low levels of the albumin protein in the blood), making it harder to move substances in the body. Tests also show low levels of white blood cells and low levels of fat lipids in the blood. She was not eating enough protein and energy (through calories) to meet nutritional needs with edema (swelling) in the stomach, requiring that more nutrition be given through the vein. After restoring protein to normal levels, her health returned and her pitting edema due to excess fluid resolved, but her arms and legs remained enlarged. She was later diagnosed with lipedema. In conclusion, this report shows that early and correct diagnosis of lipedema is important.

CASE REPORT Primary lymphedema is inherited in through an autosomal dominant pattern. Congestive cardiac failure and non-filarial infections predispose patients to the secondary form of lymphedema, elephantiasis nostras verrucosa (ENV). We present the case of a 65-year-old man with lymphedema praecox complicated by congestive cardiac failure. The patient was experiencing worsening left leg swelling and had a prior history of unilateral leg swelling at puberty. The condition was inherited through an autosomal dominant pattern, as his father, elder brother, and nephew were diagnosed with the same disease. The left leg showed non-pitting edema with indurated, woody skin and lichenification. The right leg had mild pitting edema. There were numerous verrucous folds and cobblestone-like nodules, and plaques and a painless ulcer on the left leg. Laboratory evaluation demonstrated an elevated B-type natriuretic peptide. He was treated with compression stockings and inelastic multi-layer bandaging and was administered limb decongestive treatment. After 1 week of therapy, his swelling had somewhat improved.

Researchers describe the case of a 65-year-old man with lymphedema complicated by congestive heart failure. The patient was experiencing worsening left leg swelling and had a prior history of leg swelling at puberty (when a child's body changes to become an adult) due to disease. The condition was inherited, as his father, elder brother, and nephew were diagnosed with the same disease. The left leg showed non-pitting edema (there was no indentation when the area of swelling is pressed) with woody skin due to scaring that was also thick and leathery. The right leg had mild pitting edema. There were numerous folds and cobblestone-like lumps, raised red patches of the skin, and a painless ulcer (sore) on the left leg. Lab tests showed high levels of a hormone made by the heart called B-type natriuretic peptide. He was treated with compression stockings and bandaging and given decongestive treatment in the limb which includes several techniques such as draining fluid. After 1 week of therapy, his swelling had somewhat improved.

49,27586538,"Background: Leg edema is a common adverse effect of dihydropyridine Calcium Channel Blockers (CCB) that may need dose reduction or drug withdrawal, adversely affecting the antihypertensive efficacy. Leg edema is reported to occur less often with (S)-amlodipine compared to conventional racemic amlodipine. We aimed to find the incidence of leg edema as a primary outcome and antihypertensive efficacy with (S)-amlodipine compared to conventional amlodipine. Methods: This prospective, double-blind, controlled clinical trial randomized 172 hypertensive patients, not controlled on beta-blockers (BB) and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (ACEI/ARB), to either conventional amlodipine (5-10 mg; n = 86) or (S)-amlodipine (2.5-5 mg; n = 86), while continuing their previous anti-hypertensive medications. Sample was sufficient to find a difference in edema between the interventions with 80 % power at 5 % significance level. Intension to treat analysis (ITT) for safety data and per protocol analysis for efficacy data was performed. Fischer's exact test was applied to observe difference between responder rates and proportions of subjects having peripheral edema in the two groups. Pitting edema test scores were compared using Mann-Whitney test. Results: Altogether 146 patients (amlodipine, n = 76 and (S)-amlodipine, n = 70) completed 120 days treatment. Demographic variables and treatment adherence were comparable in the two groups. Incidence of new edema after randomization was 31.40 % in test group and 46.51 % in control group [p = 0.03; absolute risk reduction (ARR) = 15.1 %; Number Needed to Treat (NNT) = 7, ITT analysis]. Pitting edema score and patient rated edema score increased significantly in the control compared to test group (p = 0.038 and 0.036 respectively) after treatment period. Edema scores increased significantly in the control group from baseline (p < 0.0001). Responders in blood pressure were 98.57 % in test and 98.68 % in control group. Most common adverse events (AE) were pitting edema and increased urinary frequency. Incidence of all AEs other than edema was similar in both groups. Two serious AEs occurred unrelated to therapy. Biochemical and ECG parameters in the two groups were comparable. Conclusions: In hypertensive patients not controlled on prior BB and ACEI/ARB therapy, addition of (S)-amlodipine besylate at half the dose of conventional amlodipine provides better tolerability with reduced incidence of peripheral edema, and equal antihypertensive efficacy compared to amlodipine given at usual doses.","Leg edema is a common side effect of dihydropyridine Calcium Channel Blockers (CCB), medicines taken to control blood pressure and other conditions. The dose amount of CBB drugs may need to be reduced or stopped, negatively impacting the drugs' use to control blood pressure. Leg edema (fluid swelling) is reported to occur less often with a type of CBB medicine called (S)-amlodipine compared to the regular racemic amlodipine medicine. Researchers aim to find the number of times leg edema appeared and how well blood pressure is lowered with (S)-amlodipine compared to conventional amlodipine. This clinical trial followed 172 patients with high blood pressure, not controlled by using beta-blockers (BB) drugs or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (ACEI/ARB) that keep blood vessels open. These patients are randomly placed in groups to receive either standard amlodipine (86 patients) or (S)-amlodipine (86 patients), while continuing their previous anti-hypertensive medications. The number of patients in this study is sufficient to find a difference in edema between the two groups. Data from both treatment groups are analyzed during the study. Data are analyzed to observe the difference between the two groups on how they responded to the treatment and the number of people who develop peripheral edema (swelling in lower legs and hands). Pitting edema, a condition where excess fluid builds up in one part of the body and pressing into the swollen area leaves a pit or indentation, is measured and scored. Altogether 146 patients completed 120 days treatment: 76 patients in the standard amlodipine group and 70 in the (S)-amlodipine group. Characteristics such as age and sex and how well patients took the medicine as directed are compared between the two groups. New edema is 31.40 % in the (S)-amlodipine group and 46.51 % in the standard group. Pitting edema score and patient rated edema score increase significantly in the amlodipine compared to (S)-amlodipine group after the treatment period. Edema scores increase significantly in the amlodipine group from the start of the study. Responders in blood pressure are 98.57 % in (S)-amlodipine and 98.68 % in amlodipine group. Most common side effects are pitting edema and increase in urinary frequency. Number of all side effects other than edema is similar in both groups. Two serious side effects occur that are unrelated to therapy. Results from other blood and heart tests in the two groups are similar. In patients with high blood pressure not controlled on prior BB and ACEI/ARB therapy, adding (S)-amlodipine besylate at half the dose of standard amlodipine provides few side effects. There is also a reduced number of peripheral edema, and equal ability to lower blood pressure compared to amlodipine given at usual doses.",1,C

His family doctor had prescribed a combination of diuretics, 40 mg furosemide and 25 mg spironolactone; however, pitting edema in his lower legs persisted. He was diagnosed with worsening of congestive heart failure because of a previous cardiac surgery and was transferred to our hospital. On admission, we closely observed the patient's condition and noticed that his body temperature increased to 38.0 °C every evening. Furthermore, his ankle joints felt feverish and were swollen. Therefore, we suspected polyarthritis as an etiology, although we initially suspected rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Antibody testing did not support RA diagnosis; therefore we concluded the association of remitting seronegative symmetrical synovitis with pitting edema (RS3PE) syndrome with his condition.

49,23979346,"Aim: Leg edema, observed on comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) of 142 elderly outpatients with a variety of chronic diseases, was studied clinically to clarify its incidence and its associated risk factors. Methods: The severity of pitting edema was assessed at 3 points, namely, the pretibial edge, medial malleolus, and the dorsum of the foot. On palpation, edema was graded as 0 to 3 for each point on one leg, the sum of which was used as the edema score. According to the edema score, subjects were divided into 3 groups; the moderate to severe (MS) group, the slight to mild (SM) group, and the group without pitting edema. The MS group was defined as having an edema score of 4 or more or edema of grade 2 or more, while the SM group was defined as having an edema score of 2 to 3 points without edema of grade 2 or more. The status of underlying disease, vascular risks, varicose veins, medications, daily activity, nutrition, total protein (TP), albumin, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were compared among the 3 groups. Results: There were 36 subjects in the MS group and 19 subjects in the SM group. Diabetes, atrial fibrillation, varicose veins, and polypharmacy were more frequent in the MS group than in the control group. Sedentary life style, house-bound, and gait trouble were significantly more frequent in the MS and SM groups. There were no significant differences in the scores of the Mini-Nutritional Assessment Short Form among the groups, although both the body weight and calf circumference in the MS group were significantly greater than those in the group without pitting edema. Low serum TP, albumin and eGFR were seen in the MS group as well as high BNP levels. Multiple regression analysis revealed diabetes, varicose veins, sedentarism, and hypoalbuminemia as risk factors associated with leg edema (R(2)=0.365, p<0.0001). Conclusion: Leg edema was frequent in the elderly outpatients and was associated strongly with diabetes, varicose veins, sedentarism, and hypoalbuminemia. These findings suggest that advising against a sedentary life style could help the resolution of edema, and also indicates the clinical usefulness of CGA. Furthermore, leg edema should be seriously considered along with nutritional assessment because edema could influence various anthropometric parameters.","In this study, leg edema (fluid swelling) is studied to understand how frequently it occurs and its associated risk factors. Leg edema is observed on a detailed evaluation of older and frail people called the comprehensive geriatric (elderly) assessment of 142 elderly outpatients with a variety of chronic diseases. The severity of pitting edema, a condition where excess fluid builds up in one part of the body and pressing into the swollen area leaves a pit or indentation, is assessed at 3 places: the shins, the bony bump on the inside of the ankle, and the top part of the foot that faces up when standing. When pressing on the swollen area, edema is graded as 0 to 3 for each point on one leg, the sum of which was used as the edema score. According to the edema score, patients are divided into 3 groups; the moderate to severe group, the slight to mild group, and the group without pitting edema. The moderate to severe group is defined as having an edema score of 4 or more or edema of grade 2 or more, while the slight to mild group is defined as having an edema score of 2 to 3 points without edema of grade 2 or more. The following tests and measurements are compared among the 3 groups: the status of underlying disease, risks to developing heart problems, varicose (twisted, enlarged) veins, medications, daily activity, nutrition, tests for proteins in the body, and tests for how well the kidneys are working. There are 36 patients in the moderate to severe group and 19 subjects in the slight to mild group. Diabetes, an irregular heart beat (atrial fibrillation), varicose veins, and being on multiple drugs at one time are more frequent in the moderate to severe group than in the comparison group. Sedentary life style (no or little physical activity), house-bound, and walking trouble are much more frequent in the moderate to severe and slight to mild groups. There are no significant differences in the scores on malnourishment (poor nutrition) among the groups, although both the body weight and calf circumference (size) in the moderate to severe group are much greater than those in the group without pitting edema. Low levels of total protein in the blood, another protein made by liver called albumin, and kidney function tests are seen in the moderate to severe group as well as high levels of a protein made by heart and blood vessels called BNP. Data analysis revealed diabetes, varicose veins, sedentarism (inactivity), and low levels of the protein albumin as risk factors associated with leg edema. In conclusion, leg edema is frequent in the elderly outpatients and is associated strongly with diabetes, varicose veins, sedentarism, and low levels of albumin in the blood. These findings suggest that advising against an inactive life style could help resolve edema, and also indicates the usefulness of comprehensive geriatric assessment to evaluate older populations.

50,10530060,"Purpose: To evaluate the practical value of initial C-reactive protein (CRP) in the diagnosis of bacterial infection in children. Methods: The subjects comprised 11 children, six boys and five girls, aged 3 months through to 3 years (median age 16 months), whose initial CRP levels were < 1.0 mg/dL despite bacterial infection. C-reactive protein was quantitated at the first medical examination by nephelometry. Results: The diagnosis was urinary tract infection (n = 4), bacterial meningitis (n = 2), sepsis (n = 2), pneumonia (n = 2) and arthritis of the hip joint (n = 1). The CRP levels were significantly elevated during the course of infection, ranging from 7.6 to 28.5 mg/dL. The bacterial etiology was non-specific. Eight patients were examined within 12 h of onset, three exhibited negative CRP values despite the duration of the insult over 12 h. Six patients were tentatively diagnosed as having a bacterial infection, but the other five were not. Each patient was treated, leading to a favorable outcome without any serious complications. Conclusions: Low levels of CRP do not rule out the possibility of bacterial infection in children. The initial value of CRP may be negative, even in patients with severe bacterial infection or even after 12 h from onset. The data suggest that pediatricians should consistently be aware of the possibility of bacterial infection even if the initial CRP test result is negative and that serial CRP measurements appear to be practical.","The aim of this paper was to determine how C-reactive protein volume in patients can help diagnose bacterial infections in children. C-reactive protein is a type of protein found in the blood that increases during times of internal inflammation (redness and swelling from infection-fighting). The study evaluated 11 children. The group consisted of six boys and five girls that were between 3 months to 3 years of age. All of the children's' initial CRP levels were < 1.0 mg/dL despite bacterial infection. C-reactive protein was measured at the first medical examination. The eleven children were diagnosed with various illnesses. These include: 4 with urinary tract infection, 2 with bacterial meningitis (inflammation with intense headaches), 2 with sepsis (life-threatening condition when the body's response to infection damages itself), 2 with pneumonia (lung infection) and 1 with arthritis of the hip joint. CRP levels were increased during the course of infection. The cause of the bacterial infections were not specified. Eight patients were examined within 12 h of illness. Three showed negative CRP values despite the duration of the illness over 12 h. Six patients were tentatively diagnosed as having a bacterial infection. The other five were not. Each patient was treated. Treatment led to better health status without any serious complications. Low levels of CRP do not rule out the possibility of bacterial infection in children. The initial value of CRP may be negative, even in patients with severe bacterial infection or even after 12 h from onset. The data suggest that doctors of children should always be aware of the possibility of bacterial infection even if the initial CRP test result is negative (no detection) and that serial (multiple) CRP measurements appear to be practical.",1,B

We therefore prospectively measured the serum C-reactive protein in 17 patients with active pulmonary sarcoidosis, 10 patients with other chronic interstitial lung diseases of unknown etiology, 11 patients with active lung tuberculosis, and 10 healthy volunteers. Serum C-reactive protein was assayed by enzymoimmunodiffusion test. The serum C-reactive protein was negative in 13 patients suffering from active sarcoidosis and positive in four. Patients with other interstitial lung diseases had negative results in 7 and positive in 3 cases. The analyses of C-reactive protein in patients with sputum positive lung tuberculosis were positive in 10 cases. All the healthy controls had negative C-reactive protein measurements. The difference between the groups was statistically significant when sarcoidosis and tuberculosis serum C-reactive protein measurements were compared (p less than 0.01), as well as the difference between the group of other interstitial lung diseases and tuberculosis (p less than 0.01).

We therefore prospectively measured the serum C-reactive protein in 17 patients with active pulmonary sarcoidosis, 10 patients with other chronic interstitial lung diseases of unknown etiology, 11 patients with active lung tuberculosis, and 10 healthy volunteers. Serum C-reactive protein was assayed by enzymoimmunodiffusion test. The serum C-reactive protein was negative in 13 patients suffering from active sarcoidosis and positive in four. Patients with other interstitial lung diseases had negative results in 7 and positive in 3 cases. The analyses of C-reactive protein in patients with sputum positive lung tuberculosis were positive in 10 cases. All the healthy controls had negative C-reactive protein measurements. The difference between the groups was statistically significant when sarcoidosis and tuberculosis serum C-reactive protein measurements were compared (p less than 0.01), as well as the difference between the group of other interstitial lung diseases and tuberculosis (p less than 0.01). In this respect, the measurements of serum C-reactive protein are valuable in the differentiation of sarcoidosis and other chronic interstitial lung diseases of unknown etiology from tuberculosis and other diseases which are known to induce an acute phase response.","Sarcoidosis is a disease characterized by growths of inflammatory cells in the body. The activated macrophage, a specialized white blood cell defender against invaders, in sarcoidosis produces interleukin-1 (Il-1), a molecule which signals inflammation. Interleukin-1, among other functions, activates the liver production of C-reactive protein, a marker of inflammation. We measured the blood C-reactive protein in 17 patients with active lung-related sarcoidosis, 10 with other long-lasting lung diseases of unknown cause, 11 with active lung tuberculosis (a bacterial lung infection), and 10 healthy volunteers. Blood C-reactive protein was measured with a specific lab test. The blood C-reactive protein was not detected in 13 patients with active sacroidosis and was detected in four. C-reactive protein was not detected in 7 patients with other lung diseases and was detected in 3 cases. The tests of C-reactive protein in patients with lung tuberculosis-related mucus was detected in 10 cases. No C-reactive protein was detected in healthy patients. There was a difference between groups when sarcoidosis and tuberculosis blood C-reactive protein measurements were compared, along with a difference between the group of other lung diseases and tuberculosis.

50,28756540,"Background: There is no agreeing if rescue therapy can avoid short-term colectomy in patients treated for severe steroid-refractory ulcerative colitis. Aims: The aim of our study was to identify predictors of response to infliximab and cyclosporine A. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 49 patients with severe ulcerative colitis were included. Response to therapy was defined as three or more point reductions in Mayo score after 6 months of treatment and avoidance of colectomy after 1 year. The predictors analysed were gender, age, time from ulcerative colitis diagnosis, months of steroid or/and azathioprine therapy before onset of the severe phase, smoking habits, extension of the disease, laboratory analyses and Mayo score. Results: Patients treated with infliximab showed a statistically significant higher response rate in case of moderate Mayo score (P = 0.04). Ex-smokers had very low chance of response to infliximab (P = 0.03). In the group treated with cyclosporine A, patients with C-reactive protein >3 mg/L had a response rate significantly higher than those with C-reactive protein <3 mg/L (P = 0.03); those with negative C-reactive protein and moderate Mayo score did not responded to therapy, while in the ones with elevated C-reactive protein and/or severe Mayo score, 15 versus 4 responded (P = 0.008). Conclusions: Our data suggest that cyclosporine A is advisable in ex-smokers. In never smokers or active smokers, infliximab can be prescribed in case of Mayo score ≤10 and/or negative CRP, while cyclosporine A is indicated in case of Mayo score >10 and positive CRP.","It is unknown if rescue therapy, or therapy given after an ailment does not respond to normal treatment, can avoid colectomy (removal of all or parts of colon) in patients treated for severe steroid-refractory ulcerative colitis. Steroid-refractory ulcerative colitis is chronic inflammatory bowel disease that no longer responds to steroid treatment. The aim of this study was to identify predictors of response to infliximab and cyclosporine A, drugs that aim to improve the immune system. In this study, 49 patients with severe ulcerative colitis were included. Response to therapy was characterized as three or more point reductions in Mayo score (a disease ranking system) after 6 months of treatment and avoidance of colectomy after 1 year. Increased Mayo score indicated worsened disease condition. The predictors evaluated were gender, age, time from ulcerative colitis diagnosis, months of steroid or/and azathioprine therapy before onset of the severe phase, smoking habits, extension of the disease, laboratory analyses and Mayo score. Azathioprine is a medication given to improve immune function. Patients treated with infliximab showed a statistically significant higher response rate in case of moderate Mayo score. Ex-smokers had very low chance of response to infliximab. In the group treated with cyclosporine A, patients with a higher volume of C-reactive protein had a response rate significantly higher than those with lower C-reactive protein volume.

A marker to distinguish bacterial from nonbacterial fever in these conditions is clinically important. The purpose of our study was to evaluate, in the early postcardiac surgery period, whether serial measurement of C-reactive protein (CRP) and its change over time (CRP velocity) can assist in detecting bacterial infection. A series of consecutive children who underwent cardiac surgery with bypass were tested for serum levels of CRP at several points up to 5 days postoperatively and during febrile episodes (>38.0°C). Findings were compared among febrile patients with proven bacterial infection (FWI group; sepsis, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, deep wound infection), febrile patients without bacterial infection (FNI group), and patients without fever (NF group). In all, 121 children were enrolled in the study, 31 in the FWI group, 42 in the FNI group, and 48 patients in the NF group. Ages ranged from 4 days to 17.8 years (median 19.0, mean 46 ± 56 months). There was no significant difference among the groups in mean CRP level before surgery, 1 hour, and 18 hours after. A highly significant interaction was found in the change in CRP over time by FWI group compared with FNI group (P < .001).

In addition to acting as a marker for asymptomatic and latent diabetes and prediabetes, it seems that the presence of I.C.Ab in the serum may define a new group of potential diabetics with normal G.T.T.S. Many such subjects have one or more organ-specific autoimmune disorders (irrespective of diabetic family history), but some are first-degree relatives of I.C.Ab-positive subjects (mainly I.D.D.). About 0-5% of the general population also have I.C.Ab in their serum.","We found pancreatic islet-cell antibodies (I.C.Ab; proteins made against insulin-producing cells in the pancreas) in 31 patients with disorders where the body's defense system attacks certain organs; 4 parents, siblings, or children of people with I.C.Ab-positive diabetes, and 1 apparently normal person, none of whom had symptoms of diabetes. Of these 36 people, glucose (sugar molecule)-tolerance tests (G.T.T.S) showed 10 had diabetes, 4 had lag storage (normal glucose levels spike and return to normal), and 22 had normal results. Two people had latent diabetes (slow progressing with features of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes) while pregnant and thyrotoxicosis (too much metabolism-regulating thyroid hormone in the body) and another 2 later developed type 1 diabetes. Blood from 26 people had been stored for 1-11 years before we did the oral (by mouth) tests that measures the body's response to sugar (glucose). I.C.Ab measurements rose and fell in some patients and stayed constant in other patients. No relationship existed between the measurement, change in measurement, or the length of I.C.Ab or the presence of antigens (substances that causes the body to defend itself) and the G.T.T. result. I.C.Ab in the blood can indicate diabetes without symptoms and slow-progressing diabetes and prediabetes and may signal a new group of possible diabetics with normal G.T.T.S. Many possible diabetics with normal G.T.T.S. have at least one disorder where the body's defense system attacks certain organs (regardless of family history of diabetes), but some are parents, siblings, or children of people with I.C.Ab (mainly type 1 diabetes). About 0-5% of the general population also have I.C.Ab in their blood.",1,B

Besides the islets, HISL-19-reactive antigenic determinants are also expressed on selected cell types, namely, gut endocrine cells, thyroid parafollicular cells (p120), anterior pituitary cells (p40 and p24), specific hypothalamic neuroendocrine cells, and a single layer of large pyramidal cells of the cerebral cortex, thus defining a new family of neuroendocrine molecules.","A lab-made islet cell antibody (proteins made against insulin-producing cells), HISL-19, that reacts with clusters of cells that produce hormones in the sugar-regulating pancreas of the human, cow, and pig has been used to find and describe a new group of islet (pancreatic) cell proteins (p120, p69, p67, and p56). HISL-19 is also reactive with other related tissues that can be grouped into a new family of neuroendocrine (cells like nerve cells that make hormones) molecules.",1,B
51,1826249,"It has been suggested that screening all patients with diabetes diagnosed in later life for islet cell antibodies (ICA) would help predict insulin dependence. We have surveyed the case notes of 55 patients (22 male; ages 37-88 years) who were found to be ICA positive over a 9-year screening period to assess what contribution knowledge of ICA status made to their management. Forty-two patients had been put on insulin (half within 6 months of diagnosis and the rest after up to 6 years). Of the 13 patients not on insulin, six were on diet alone and seven on oral hypoglycaemic agents after a median follow-up of 3 years. In 37 of the 42 patients, insulin treatment was started for clinical rather than immunological reasons (diabetic ketoacidosis, ketonuria, weight loss and/or severe symptoms). Five patients were started on insulin because of ICA status when there was no compelling reason on clinical grounds. Knowledge that seven non-insulin-treated patients were ICA positive made doctors reluctant to discharge them from clinic. The data suggest that routine ICA estimation in this age group is unnecessary, as the decision to treat with insulin is best made on clinical grounds, and ICA estimation can lead to unwarranted insulin treatment, or anxiety in patients and doctors who are aware of a positive result.","Checking all people with diabetes detected later in life for islet cell antibodies (ICA; proteins made against insulin-producing cells) may help predict dependence on insulin. We read doctor notes of 55 patients (22 male; ages 37-88 years) who were found to be ICA positive (with ICA) over a 9-year checking period to determine what role ICA status made to their treatment. Forty-two patients had been put on insulin (half within 6 months of diagnosis and half after up to 6 years). Of the 13 patients not on insulin, six were on health diet and seven were on oral (by mouth) medication after about 3 years. In 37 of the 42 patients, insulin treatment was started due to observable symptoms (high levels of blood acids called ketones, high levels of ketones in urine, weight loss, and/or serious symptoms) rather than issues related to the body's defense system. Five patients were started on insulin due to ICA status where no observable symptoms existed. Doctors were hesitant to send home 7 non-insulin-treated, ICA-positive patients. The data suggest that regularly estimating ICA in this age group is not needed, as the decision to treat with insulin should be based on observable symptoms, and ICF estimation can cause unneeded insulin treatment, or anxiety in patients and doctors due to a positive result.",1,B
51,1541379,"Basal insulin secretion was compared in nine islet-cell antibody positive, non-diabetic first-degree relatives of children with Type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus and nine normal control subjects matched for age, sex and weight. Acute insulin responses to a 25 g intravenous glucose tolerance test were similar in the two groups (243 (198-229) vs 329 (285-380) mU.l-1 x 10 min-1, mean (+/- SE), p = 0.25). Fasting plasma insulin was assayed in venous samples taken at one min intervals for 2 h. Time series analysis was used to demonstrate oscillatory patterns in plasma insulin. Autocorrelation showed that regular oscillatory activity was generally absent in the islet-cell antibody-positive group, whereas a regular 13 min cycle was shown in control subjects (p less than 0.0001). Fourier transformation did, however, show a 13 min spectral peak in the islet-cell antibody positive group, consistent with intermittent pulsatility. We conclude that overall oscillatory patterns of basal insulin secretion are altered in islet-cell antibody positive subjects even when the acute insulin response is within the normal range.","We compared background insulin release in nine islet-cell antibody (protein made against insulin-producing cells) positive, non-diabetic parents or siblings of children with type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes and nine normal people matched for age, sex and weight. Short-term insulin responses to an I.V. (injected) glucose tolerance test were similar in the two groups. We measured blood insulin in people who had not had anything to eat for a period of time in blood samples taken every minute for 2 hours. We looked at blood insulin over time to see how it rises and falls. The islet-cell antibody-positive group (group with the antibody) did not have a regular pattern, but normal people had a 13-minute cycle. The islet-cell antibody-positive group did have a peak every 13 minutes.

51,8003613,"Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is associated with the formation of autoantibodies against different antigens in the islets of Langerhans, so-called islet cell antibodies (ICA). The expression of a major autoantigen, the beta-cell specific enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), is glucose-dependent in vitro and correlated to insulin release in vitro. In this study the expression of islet autoantigens was examined in vivo and the relationship between beta-cell function and islet cell surface antibody (ICSA) reactivity was tested. Rats were fed for 10 days with glipizide or diazoxide, in order to stimulate or inhibit insulin release, respectively. Frozen sections of pancreata were incubated with ten ICA-positive IDDM sera and analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence. Two sera with a ""beta-cell restricted"" staining, five with an ""all-islet cell"" staining and three with a ""mixed"" pattern were employed. In all three groups, the highest end-point titres were obtained when pancreata of rats treated with glipizide were used. Intermediate titres were seen in control animals and the lowest titres were observed on pancreata from diazoxide-treated rats, regardless of the serum used. In contrast to these observations, no correlation between ICSA reactivity and islet cell activity could be demonstrated. Conflicting results concerning ICSA in previous reports and our failure to show a glucose regulation of ICSA reactivity, indicate that ICSA is a phenomenon with a low degree of specificity.","Type 1 diabetes is associated with the formation of self-made proteins against different toxins in the islets of Langerhans (a group of insulin-producing cells in the pancreas), known as islet cell antibodies (ICA).

We looked at expression of islet self-made markers in pancreatic cells and tested the relationship between beta-cell (insulin-producing cell) function and islet cell surface antibody (ICSA) reactivity. We fed rats glipizide or diazoxide (insulin-treating drugs) for 10 days to increase or decrease insulin release, respectively. Sections of the pancreas were analyzed. We saw the highest measurements in rats given glipizide. We saw medium measurements in animals not given drugs, and the lowest measurements in rats given diazoxide. Opposite to these findings, we could not show a relationship between ICSA reactivity and islet cell activity. Conflicting results concerning ICSA in previous reports and our failure to show an energy regulation of ICSA reactivity, indicate that ICSA is a phenomenon with a low degree of specific detection.",1,B
51,8326015,"Measurement of beta-cell function is an important marker of progression to diabetes in individuals at risk for the disease. Although the peak incidence for the disease occurs before 17 years of age, normal values for insulin secretion were not available in this age group. We performed a simplified intravenous glucose tolerance test in 167 normal children, and in 98 islet cell antibody (ICA)-negative and 12 ICA-positive siblings of diabetic patients. Their age range was 1-16 yr. The first phase of insulin secretion, evaluated as the sum of plasma insulin concentrations at 1 and 3 min, increased with age and was significantly lower in ICA-negative siblings (86 +/- 6 microU/ml, P < 0.002) than in normal controls (115 +/- 6 microU/ml). This difference was not apparent before 8 yr of age. None of the ICA-negative siblings developed diabetes after an average of 4.5 yr. ICA-positive siblings at first study had a first phase insulin response similar to that of ICA negative siblings, but significantly lower than that of the normal controls (74 +/- 13 microU/ml, P < 0.02). The reason for the decreased insulin secretion in ICA-negative siblings is unknown, but could involve a defect in the growth of beta-cell mass or insulin secretion that could be part of the multifactorial pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes.","Measurement of cells that make insulin is an important indicator of diabetes development in people at risk for diabetes.

The first part of insulin response was similar in ICA-positive and ICA-negative siblings, but significantly lower than in normal children.

51,8786012,"We studied the effect of severe reduction of beta-cell mass by 90% pancreatectomy on the immune tolerance to the endocrine pancreas. Four months after subtotal pancreatectomy all LEW.Han rats had developed mononuclear infiltration of islets and 9 of 14 rats were positive for islet-cell antibodies. Electron microscopy revealed lymphocytic invasion of endocrine tissue, lysis of beta cells and phagocytotic macrophages. None of these changes were seen 2 weeks after 90% pancreatectomy or 4 months after 10% pancreatectomy. Weekly substitution of islet antigens in the form of a homogenate of 100 islets into 90% pancreatectomized LEW.Han rats almost completely prevented the development of insulitis and autoantibodies. The dependence of insulitis on T cells was shown when 90% pancreatectomy in LEW.rnu rats (i.e., the congenic athymic nude strain), did not result in islet infiltration. The exocrine tissue remained normal in all experimental groups. During the observation period insulitis was not associated with overt diabetes but was accompanied by substantial enlargement of islets and of beta-cell mass, as shown by morphometry. Suppression of islet inflammation by injection of islet antigens abolished beta-cell regeneration, despite continuing metabolic stress in rats with 90% pancreatectomy. The findings indicate induction of islet autoimmunity in response to 90% but not to 10% pancreatectomy. We conclude that severe reduction of the islet-antigen mass allows the development of T-cell-dependent islet autoimmunity which indicates a loss of immune tolerance. In addition, the data suggest the existence of islet-antigen autoreactive immune cells in rats not genetically predisposed to autoimmune diabetes. Finally, we conclude that selective beta-cell regeneration occurs in association with insulitis.","We studied the effect of drastically reducing beta-cell (insulin-producing cell) mass by removing 90% of the pancreas on immune tolerance (state of unresponsiveness of the body's defense) to the endocrine pancreas, which controls blood sugar levels. Four months after removal of almost all of the pancreas, all rats had developed signs of long-term inflammation (infection-fighting) response of islets (clusters of cells that produce hormones) and 9 of 14 rats had islet-cell antibodies (proteins made against insulin-producing cells). Using microscopes, we saw immune white blood cells going into the part of the pancreas that produces substances (enzymes) that help with digestion, death of beta cells, and white blood cells that remove dying and dead cells. We saw none of these changes 2 weeks after removing 90% of the pancreas or 4 months after removing 10% of the pancreas. Weekly substitution of islet antigens (substances that causes the body to defend itself) in rats with 90% of the pancreas removed prevented insulitis (disease of the pancreas caused by the infiltration of immune white blood cells) and self-made proteins. Insulitis was shown to be dependent on T cells (part of the body's defense system). The tissue that produces substances (enzymes) that help with digestion did not change in any group. During the observation period, insulitis was not related to diabetes, but we saw a sizeable increase in the sizes of islets and beta-cell mass. Decreasing islet inflammation by injecting islet antigens (fragments) stopped beta-cell regrowth, even though low energy continued in rats with 90% of the pancreas removed. The results suggest removing 90% but not 10% of the pancreas causes the body to mistakenly destroy its islets. We conclude that drastically reducing the islet-antigen mass allows the body to mistakenly destroy its islets, which shows a loss of immune tolerance. Also, the results suggest islet-antigen autoreactive immune cells exist in rats not likely to develop autoimmune diabetes (diabetes from the body mistakenly destroying its own cells). Finally, we conclude that some beta-cell regrowth happens with insulitis.",1,B
51,25482141,"Objective: Obese youth clinically diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) frequently have evidence of islet cell autoimmunity (proteins made against insulin-producing cells). We investigated the clinical and biochemical differences, and therapeutic modalities among autoantibody positive (Ab+) vs. autoantibody negative (Ab-) youth at the time of diagnosis and over time in a multi-provider clinical setting. Study design: Chart review of 145 obese youth diagnosed with T2DM from January 2003 to July 2012. Of these, 70 patients were Ab+ and 75 Ab-. The two groups were compared with respect to clinical presentation, physical characteristics, laboratory data, and therapeutic modalities at diagnosis and during follow up to assess the changes in these parameters associated with disease progression. Results: At presentation, Ab+ youth with a clinical diagnosis of T2DM were younger, had higher rates of ketosis, higher hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and glucose levels, and lower insulin and c-peptide concentrations compared with the Ab- group. The Ab- group had a higher body mass index (BMI) z-score and cardiometabolic risk factors at diagnosis and such difference remained over time. Univariate analysis revealed that treatment modality had no effect on BMI in either group. Generalized estimating equations for longitudinal data analysis revealed that (i) BMI z-score and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were significantly affected by duration of diabetes; (ii) systolic blood pressure (SBP) and ALT were affected by changes in BMI z-score; and (iii) changes in HbA1c had an effect on lipid profile and cardiometabolic risk factors regardless of antibody status. Conclusions: Irrespective of antibody status and treatment modality, youth who present with obesity and diabetes, show no improvement in obesity status over time, with the deterioration in BMI z-score affecting blood pressure (BP) and ALT, but the lipid profile being mostly impacted by HbA1c and glycemic control. Effective control of BMI and glycemia are needed to lessen the future macrovascular complications irrespective of antibody status.","Obese youth diagnosed with type 2 diabetes by a doctor often have islet cell autoimmunity (in which immune cells attack healthy cells). We looked at the observable and biochemical differences, and treatment types of self-made protein positive (Ab+) vs. self-made protein negative (Ab-) youth at diagnosis and over time at a medical facility. We reviewed medical charts of 145 obese youth diagnosed with type 2 diabetes from January 2003 to July 2012. Of these 145 youth, 70 patients were Ab+ and 75 Ab-. We compared the disease symptoms, physical qualities, lab findings, and treatment types of the two groups at diagnosis and during follow up to rate the changes in these things related to disease development. At the doctor, Ab+ youth with a doctor's diagnosis of type 2 diabetes were younger, had higher rates of not enough carbohydrates to burn, higher hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c - which indicates average blood sugar levels) and blood sugar levels, and lower insulin and signs of insulin production compared with the Ab- group. The Ab- group had a higher body mass index (BMI) score adjusted for weight and gender and risk factors for heart disease and metabolic disorders at diagnosis and did not change over time. Treatment type had no effect on BMI in either group. We found that: (i) length of diabetes affected BMI score adjusted for weight and gender and diastolic blood pressure, (ii) changes In BMI score adjusted for weight and gender affected systolic blood pressure and ALT (alanine transaminase; released into the blood when liver cells are damaged), and (iii) changes in HbA1c affected lipid profile (panel of blood tests used to find abnormalities in lipids, such as cholesterol and triglycerides) and risk factors for heart disease and metabolic disorders independent of antibody (infection-fighting protein) status. Regardless of antibody status and treatment type, obese and diabetic youth do not become less obese over time, with higher BMI affecting blood pressure and ALT, and blood sugar levels affecting the lipid profile. Controlling BMI and blood sugar levels are needed to lessen future large blood vessel problems regardless of antibody status.",1,B

Its disadvantages are the need for human pancreatic tissue and difficulty in obtaining quantitative results. In the past decade biochemically-defined beta-cell toxins were described, leading to the development of sensitive and specific autoantibody assays, to predict insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). We examined the value of combined biochemically-based serological assays, such as autoantibodies to insulin (IAA), glutamic acid decarboxylase (GADA) and ICA512 (ICA512A) to replace the traditional ICA assay. Blood samples of 114 newly diagnosed IDDM patients, aged 12 +/- 5 yrs (range 2 months-29 years) were tested for ICA (indirect immunofluorescence), IAA, GADA and ICA512A (radiobinding assay). The latter 2 assays were performed using recombinant human [35S]-labeled antigen produced by in vitro transcription/translation. We found that fewer sera scored positive for ICA and/or IAA (80.7%, 92/114) than for 1 or more of IAA, GAD, or ICA512 (88.6%, 101/114). We conclude that combined testing for IAA, GAD and ICA512 can replace the traditional ICA/IAA test to predict IDDM and is helpful in the differential diagnosis of insulin-dependent and noninsulin-dependent diabetes.","The main blood test to determine active attack of the insulin-producing beta-cells by the body is based on islet cell antibodies (ICA; proteins made against insulin-producing cells). The main ICA test has drawbacks like needing human tissue from the pancreas and difficulty in getting results in the form of a number. Based on the description of beta-cell proteins in test tubes in the past 10 years, new measuring tools for self-made proteins were made with high accuracy for disease detection and no detection to predict type 1 diabetes. We looked at whether combined blood tests in test tubes, such as self-made proteins to insulin (IAA), the enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase (GADA), and ICA512 (ICA512A), could replace the main ICA test. We tested blood samples of 114 newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes patients, aged 12 plus or minus 5 years (ranging from 2 months to 29 year) for ICA, IAA, GADA, and ICA512A. We found that more blood samples scored positive (detected the presence of the disease) for 1 or more of IAA, GAD, or ICA512 than for ICA and/or IAA. We conclude that testing for IAA, GAD and ICA512 together can replace the traditional ICA/IAA test to predict type 1 diabetes and is helpful to doctors in telling the different between type 1 and type 2 diabetes.",1,B
51,7783363,"Islet cell antibodies (ICA; proteins made against insulin-producing cells) are a marker of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). ICA are detected in 60-80% of the patients with IDDM at the onset of the disease. The presence of ICA in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) indicates that the patients are likely to develop IDDM. However, as ICA are measured by the indirect immunofluorescent method, the reliability of the ICA assay is not high in some institutes. Use of the pancreas tissue having high antigenicity is recommended as one solution for a reliable assay. Standardization of the ICA assay is under way with the use of an ICA positive standard sera as 80 JDF units. Anti-glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) antibody assays using a radioimmunoassay (RIA) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) have recently been developed. The significance of anti-GAD antibodies is comparable to that of ICA. Since the anti-GAD assay is reproducible and easy to perform, it should be used widely in parallel with the ICA assay.","Islet cell antibodies (ICA) are an indicator of type 1 diabetes. ICA are found in 60-80% of patients with type 1 diabetes when symptoms first appear. Type 2 diabetics with ICA are likely to develop type 1 diabetes.

A standardized test to measure ICA is under way. Scientists have recently developed a standardized test to measure anti-glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) antibody, a rare protein. Anti-GAD antibodies and ICA have similar meanings. The standardized test to measure anti-GAD can be repeated and is easy to do, so it should be used widely at the same time as the test to measure ICA.",1,B

53,33022987,"To date, nutritional studies have focused on the total intake of dietary fiber rather than intake timing. In this study, we examined the effect of the timing of daily Helianthus tuberosus ingestion on postprandial and 24 h glucose levels, as well as on intestinal microbiota in older adults. In total, 37 healthy older adults (age = 74.9 ± 0.8 years) were recruited. The participants were randomly assigned to either a morning group (MG, n = 18) or an evening group (EG, n = 17). The MG and EG groups were instructed to take Helianthus tuberosus powder (5 g/day) just before breakfast or dinner, respectively, for 1 week after the 1-week control period. The glucose levels of all participants were monitored using a continuous glucose monitoring system throughout the 2 weeks. The intestinal microbiota was analyzed by sequencing 16S rRNA genes from feces before and after the intervention. There were no significant differences in the physical characteristics or energy intake between groups. Helianthus tuberosus intake led to decreases in tissue glucose levels throughout the day in both groups (p < 0.01, respectively). As a result of examining the fluctuations in tissue glucose levels up to 4 hours after each meal, significant decreases in the areas under the curves (AUCs) were observed for all three meals after intervention, but only in the MG (breakfast: p = 0.012, lunch: p = 0.002, dinner: p = 0.005). On the other hand, in the EG, there was a strong decrease in the AUC after dinner, but only slight decreases after breakfast and lunch (breakfast: p = 0.017, lunch: p = 0.427, dinner: p = 0.002). Moreover, the rate of change in the peak tissue glucose level at breakfast was significantly decreased in the MG compared to the EG (p = 0.027). A greater decrease was observed in the change in the blood glucose level after the ingestion of Helianthus tuberosus in the MG than in the EG. Furthermore, the relative abundance of Ruminococcus in the MG at the genus level was significantly higher at baseline than in the EG (p = 0.016) and it was also significantly lower after the intervention (p = 0.013). Our findings indicate that Helianthus tuberosus intake in the morning might have relatively stronger effects on the intestinal microbiota and suppress postprandial glucose levels to a greater extent than when taken in the evening.","To date, nutritional studies have focused on the total amount of dietary fiber consumed rather than when the fiber was consumed. In this study, researchers examine the effect of the timing of daily ingestion of Jerusalem artichoke (sunroot, Helianthus tuberosus) on blood sugar levels after meals and at 24 hours, as well as on gut bacteria in older adults. In total, 37 healthy older adults (age = 74.9 ± 0.8 years) are recruited. The participants are randomly assigned to either a morning group (18 participants) or an evening group (17 participants). The morning group is instructed to take Jerusalem artichoke powder just before breakfast, and the evening group to take it just before dinner. Each group took the powder for 1 week. The blood sugar levels of all participants are monitored using a continuous blood sugar monitoring system throughout the 2 weeks. The gut bacteria is analyzed from feces (poop) before and after participants consumed the Jerusalem artichoke. There are no significant differences in the physical characteristics or the amount of calories consumed between groups. Consuming Jerusalem artichoke leads to decreases in tissue blood sugar levels throughout the day in both groups. As a result of examining the changes in tissue blood glucose levels up to 4 hours after each meal, big decreases in the overall exposure to the Jerusalem artichoke in the body is observed for all three meals after intervention (treatment), but only in the morning group. On the other hand, in the evening group, there is a strong decrease in the overall exposure to the plant after dinner, but only slight decreases after breakfast and lunch. Additionally, the rate of change in the max tissue blood sugar level at breakfast is significantly decreased in the morning group compared to the evening group. A greater decrease is observed in the change in the blood sugar level after the ingestion of Jerusalem artichoke in the morning group than in the evening group. Furthermore, the relative abundance of a gut bacteria that can break down fiber called Ruminococcus in the morning group is much higher at the start of the study than in the evening group, and it is also much lower after the study. The findings suggest that consuming Jerusalem artichoke in the morning might have relatively stronger effects on the gut bacteria and slow post-meal blood sugar levels to a greater extent than when taken in the evening.",1,C
53,12713453,"Background: In diabetic patients, postprandial glucose levels, which have a major impact on metabolic control, are determined by the rate of nutrient delivery into the intestine, absorption of nutrients from the small intestine, and the metabolism of the absorbed nutrients by the liver.

Material and methods: Thirty Type 1 diabetic patients together with 15 sex- and age-matched healthy controls were enrolled in the study. After an overnight fasting all patients and controls received 100 micro Ci 51 Cr of EDTA as a radioactive tracer and the percentage of the isotope excreted in a 24-h urinary specimen was the permeability measure. Instant blood glucose was measured just before the test, and the patients performed and recorded self-monitoring of fasting and 2nd-hour postprandial blood glucose levels during the following week. Results: We found that intestinal permeability is increased in Type 1 diabetic patients compared with age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Increased intestinal permeability is related at least in part to the instant blood glucose level and the presence of diabetic autonomic neuropathy. Conclusion: Increased intestinal permeability leads to higher variation in postprandial blood glucose levels, thereby worsening metabolic control.","In diabetic patients, blood sugar levels after meals, which have a major impact on how nutrients in the body are used, are determined by several factors: the rate of nutrient delivery into the stomach, absorption of nutrients from the small intestine that helps further digestion of food, and the metabolism of the nutrients absorbed by the liver. The present study addresses whether Type 1 diabetic patients have increased intestinal permeability, the control of material passing from the stomach and to the rest of the body, and how intestinal permeability predicts different levels of blood sugar after meals. Thirty Type 1 diabetic patients and 15 healthy people as controls (comparison group) are enrolled in the study. After an overnight fasting (no food), all patients and controls receive a substance called EDTA that allows internal images of the body to be seen, and the amount of the substance released in a 24-hour urine sample is how intestinal permeability is measured. During the following week, instant blood sugar is measured just before the test, and the patients performed and recorded self-monitoring of fasting and blood sugar levels 2 hours after meals. Researchers found that intestinal permeability is increased in Type 1 diabetic patients compared with healthy controls. Increased intestinal permeability is related at least in part to the instant blood sugar level and the presence of a type of nerve damage that can occur with diabetes. Increased intestinal permeability that allows substances to pass from the stomach to the body leads to higher differences in post-meal blood sugar levels, thereby worsening the body's ability to control the use and distribution of nutrients.",1,C
53,31211392,"Objective: To determine the effect of morning exercise in the fasting condition vs afternoon exercise on blood glucose responses to resistance exercise (RE). Research design and methods: For this randomized crossover design, 12 participants with type 1 diabetes mellitus [nine females; aged 31 ± 8.9 years; diabetes duration, 19.1 ± 8.3 years; HbA1c, 7.4% ± 0.8% (57.4 ± 8.5 mmol/mol)] performed ∼40 minutes of RE (three sets of eight repetitions, seven exercises, at the individual's predetermined eight repetition maximum) at either 7 am (fasting) or 5 pm. Sessions were performed at least 48 hours apart. Venous blood samples were collected immediately preexercise, immediately postexercise, and 60 minutes postexercise. Interstitial glucose was monitored overnight postexercise by continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). Results: Data are presented as mean ± SD. Blood glucose rose during fasting morning exercise (9.5 ± 3.0 to 10.4 ± 3.0 mmol/L), whereas it declined with afternoon exercise (8.2 ± 2.5 to 7.4 ± 2.6 mmol/L; P = 0.031 for time-by-treatment interaction). Sixty minutes postexercise, blood glucose concentration was significantly higher after fasting morning exercise than after afternoon exercise (10.9 ± 3.2 vs 7.9 ± 2.9 mmol/L; P = 0.019). CGM data indicated more glucose variability (2.7 ± 1.1 vs 2.0 ± 0.7 mmol/L; P = 0.019) and more frequent hyperglycemia (12 events vs five events; P = 0.025) after morning RE than after afternoon RE. Conclusions: Compared with afternoon RE, morning (fasting) RE was associated with distinctly different blood glucose responses and postexercise profiles.","The objective of this study is to determine the effect of morning exercise after fasting (no food or drink except water for 8 to 10 hours) vs afternoon exercise on blood sugar responses to resistance exercise, also known as strength or weight training to build muscle.

Sessions are performed at least 48 hours apart. Blood samples are collected immediately before exercise, immediately after exercise, and 60 minutes after exercise. Interstitial sugar is taken from the fluid surrounding the cells of tissues rather the blood. Interstitial sugar is monitored overnight after exercise by using continuous sugar monitoring device. Blood sugar rises during fasting morning exercise, whereas it declined with afternoon exercise. Sixty minutes after exercise, blood sugar is significantly higher after fasting morning exercise than after afternoon exercise. Data from the continuous sugar monitoring device indicated more changes in sugar levels and more frequent hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) after morning resistance exercise than after afternoon resistance exercise.

53,25555390,"Background: Although physical exercise (PE) is recommended for individuals with type 1 diabetes (DM1), participation in exercise is challenging because it increases the risk of severe hypoglycemia and the available therapeutic options to prevent it frequently result in hyperglycemia. There is no clear recommendation about the best timing for exercise. The aim of this study was to compare the risk of hypoglycemia after morning or afternoon exercise sessions up to 36 hours postworkout. Methods: This randomized crossover study enrolled subjects with DM1, older than 18 years of age, on sensor-augmented insulin pump (SAP) therapy. Participants underwent 2 moderate-intensity exercise sessions; 1 in the morning and 1 in the afternoon, separated by a 7 to 14 day wash-out period. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data were collected 24 hours before, during and 36 hours after each session. Results: Thirty-five subjects (mean age 30.31 ± 12.66 years) participated in the study. The rate of hypoglycemia was significantly lower following morning versus afternoon exercise sessions (5.6 vs 10.7 events per patient, incidence rate ratio, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.43-0.63; P < .0001). Most hypoglycemic events occurred 15-24 hours after the session. On days following morning exercise sessions, there were 20% more CGM readings in near-euglycemic range (70-200 mg/dL) than on days prior to morning exercise (P = .003). Conclusions: Morning exercise confers a lower risk of late-onset hypoglycemia than afternoon exercise and improves metabolic control on the subsequent day.","Although physical exercise is recommended for individuals with type 1 diabetes, participation in exercise is challenging because it increases the risk of severe hypoglycemia (very low blood sugar) and the available treatment options to prevent it often result in hyperglycemia (high blood sugar).

53,23831240,"Objectives: Afternoon napping is a common habit in China. We used data obtained from the Dongfeng-Tongji cohort to examine if duration of habitual afternoon napping was associated with risks for impaired fasting plasma glucose (IFG) and diabetes mellitus (DM) in a Chinese elderly population. Methods: A total of 27,009 participants underwent a physical examination, laboratory tests, and face-to-face interview. They were categorized into four groups according to nap duration (no napping, <30, 30 to <60, 60 to <90, and > or =90 min). Logistic regression models were used to examine the odds ratios (ORs) of napping duration with IFG and DM. Results: Of the participants, 18,515 (68.6%) reported regularly taking afternoon naps. Those with longer nap duration had considerably higher prevalence of IFG and DM. Napping duration was associated in a dose-dependent manner with IFG and DM (P<.001). After adjusting for possible confounders, longer nap duration (>60 min; all P<.05) was still significantly associated with increased risk for IFG, and longer nap duration (>30 min) was associated with increased risk for DM; however, this finding was not significant in the group with a nap duration of 60-90 min. Conclusions: Longer habitual afternoon napping was associated with a moderate increase for DM risk, independent of several covariates. This finding suggests that longer nap duration may represent a novel risk factor for DM and higher blood glucose levels.","Afternoon napping is a common habit in China. Researchers use data obtained from an existing study to examine if duration of regular afternoon napping is associated with risks for impaired fasting (no food and/or water for a period of time) plasma (blood) glucose (pre-diabetes) and diabetes in a Chinese elderly population. A total of 27,009 participants undergo a physical examination, lab tests, and face-to-face interview. They are placed into groups based on nap duration. The groups are: no napping, less than 30 minutes, 30 to less than 60 minutes, 60 to less than 90 minutes, and 90 minutes or more.

53,21411550,"Context: Endogenous glucocorticoid excess (Cushing's syndrome) predominantly increases postprandial glucose concentration. The pattern of hyperglycemia induced by prednisolone has not been well characterized. Objective: Our objective was to define the circadian effect of prednisolone on glucose concentration to optimize management of prednisolone-induced hyperglycemia. Design and setting: This was a cross-sectional study in a teaching hospital. Participants: Participants included 60 consecutive consenting subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease admitted to hospital: 13 without known diabetes admitted for other indications and not treated with glucocorticoids (group 1), 40 without known diabetes admitted with an exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and treated with prednisolone (group 2, prednisolone = 30 ± 6 mg/d), and seven with known diabetes treated with prednisolone (group 3, prednisolone = 26 ± 9 mg/d). Main outcome measure: Interstitial glucose concentration was assessed during continuous glucose monitoring. Results: Significantly more subjects in group 2 [21 of 40 (53%), P = 0.02] and group 3 [seven of seven (100%), P = 0.003] recorded a glucose of at least 200 mg/dl (≥11.1 mmol/liter) during continuous glucose monitoring than in group 1 [one of 13 (8%)]. The mean glucose concentration between 2400-1200 h for group 3 (142 ± 36 mg/dl) was significantly greater than in the other two groups (P < 0.005), whereas mean glucose concentrations between 2400-1200 h in group 1 (108 ± 16 mg/dl) and group 2 (112 ± 22 mg/dl) were not significantly different. In contrast, the mean glucose concentrations between 1200-2400 h for group 2 (142 ± 25 mg/dl) and group 3 (189 ± 32 mg/dl) were both significantly greater than group 1 (117 ± 14 mg/dl, P < 0.05 for both comparisons). Conclusions: Prednisolone predominantly causes hyperglycemia in the afternoon and evening. Treatment of prednisolone-induced hyperglycemia should be targeted at this time period.","Endogenous glucocorticoid excess (Cushing's syndrome) is caused when the body has too much of the stress hormone cortisol over a long period of time. It increases the level of blood sugar concentration up to 4 hours after eating a meal. The pattern of hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) caused by prednisolone, a steroid drug made to act like the cortisol hormone, has not been well described. The objective of this study is to define the 24 hour effect of prednisolone on blood sugar concentration to help manage hyperglycemia brought about by prednisolone. This study takes place in a teaching hospital. Participants include 60 people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a lung disease making it difficult to breathe, admitted to the hospital and placed into groups. Thirteen participants (group 1) without known diabetes are admitted for other problems and not treated with glucocorticoids, drugs used to fight inflammation (effects of infection-fighting). Forty participants without known diabetes are admitted with an extreme COPD and treated with prednisolone (group 2). Seven participants with known diabetes are treated with prednisolone (group 3). Interstitial glucose concentration is taken from the fluid surrounding the cells of tissues rather the blood and is assessed (measured) during continuous glucose monitoring that regularly check sugar levels. Significantly more participants in group 2 and group 3 recorded a glucose of at least 200 mg/dl during continuous glucose monitoring than in group 1. The average glucose concentration between midnight and noon (2400-1200 hours) for group 3 is much greater than in the other two groups, whereas the average glucose concentrations between midnight and noon (2400-1200 hours) in group 1 and group 2 are not significantly different.

53,21388440,"Aims: Individuals with Type 1 diabetes mellitus are susceptible to hypoglycaemia during and after continuous moderate-intensity exercise, but hyperglycaemia during intermittent high-intensity exercise. The combination of both forms of exercise may have a moderating effect on glycaemia in recovery. The aims of this study were to compare the physiological responses and associated glycaemic changes to continuous moderate-intensity exercise vs. continuous moderate-intensity exercise + intermittent high-intensity exercise in athletes with Type 1 diabetes. Methods: Interstitial glucose levels were measured in a blinded fashion in 11 trained athletes with Type 1 diabetes during two sedentary days and during 2 days in which 45 min of afternoon continuous moderate-intensity exercise occurred either with or without intermittent high-intensity exercise. The total amount of work performed and the duration of exercise was identical between sessions. Results: During exercise, heart rate, respiratory exchange ratio, oxygen utilization, ventilation and blood lactate levels were higher during continuous moderate-intensity + intermittent high-intensity exercise vs. continuous moderate-intensity exercise (all P < 0.05). Despite these marked cardiorespiratory differences between trials, there was no difference in the reduction of interstitial glucose or plasma glucose levels between the exercise trials. Nocturnal glucose levels were higher in continuous moderate-intensity + intermittent high-intensity exercise and in sedentary vs. continuous moderate-intensity exercise (P < 0.05). Compared with continuous moderate-intensity exercise alone, continuous moderate-intensity + intermittent high-intensity exercise was associated with less post-exercise hypoglycaemia (5.2 vs. 1.5% of the time spent with glucose < 4.0 mmol/l) and more post-exercise hyperglycaemia (33.8 vs. 20.4% of time > 11.0 mmol/l). Conclusions: Although the decreases in glucose level during continuous moderate-intensity exercise and continuous moderate-intensity + intermittent high-intensity exercise are similar, the latter form of exercise protects against nocturnal hypoglycaemia in athletes with Type 1 diabetes.","People with Type 1 diabetes are vulnerable to developing low blood sugar, also called hypoglycemia, during and after continuous moderate-level exercise, but they are also at risk of high blood sugar (hyperglycemia) during periodic high-intensity exercise. The combination of both moderate and high-intensity exercise may have an effect on blood sugar levels. The aims of this study are to compare the body's physical responses and blood sugar changes to continuous moderate-intensity exercise vs. continuous moderate-intensity exercise + periodic high-intensity exercise in athletes with Type 1 diabetes. Interstitial sugar levels are taken from the fluid surrounding the cells of tissues in 11 trained athletes with Type 1 diabetes. Samples are taken during two days when they were not active and during 2 days in which 45 minutes of afternoon continuous moderate-intensity exercise occurred either with or without periodic high-intensity exercise. The total amount of work performed and the duration of exercise is identical between sessions. During exercise, heart rate, respiratory exchange ratio to determine how the body is getting energy, oxygen utilization, ventilation (breathing) and blood lactatic acid (waste build-up from exercise) levels are higher during continuous moderate-intensity + intermittent high-intensity exercise vs. continuous moderate-intensity exercise. Despite these noticeable heart-lung differences, there is no difference in the reduction of interstitial sugar or blood sugar levels between the exercise trials. Nighttime sugar levels are higher in continuous moderate-intensity + periodic high-intensity exercise and in inactive vs. continuous moderate-intensity exercise.

53,10535452,"The objective of this study was to evaluate whether first-degree relatives (FDRs) of patients with type 2 diabetes had abnormal circadian insulin secretion and, if so, whether this abnormality affected their glucose metabolism. Six African-American FDRs with normal glucose tolerance and 12 matched normal control subjects (who had no family history of diabetes) were exposed to 48 h of hyperglycemic clamping (approximately 12 mmol/l). Insulin secretion rates (ISRs) were determined by deconvolution of plasma C-peptide levels using individual C-peptide kinetic parameters. Detrending and smoothing of data (z-scores) and computation of autocorrelation functions were used to identify ISR cycles. During the initial hours after start of glucose infusions, ISRs were approximately 60% higher in FDRs than in control subjects (585 vs. 366 nmol/16 h, P < 0.05), while rates of glucose uptake were the same (5.6 mmol x kg(-1) x h(-1)), indicating that the FDRs were insulin resistant. Control subjects had well-defined circadian (24 h) cycles of ISR and plasma insulin that rose in the early morning, peaked in the afternoon, and declined during the night. In contrast, FDRs had several shorter ISR cycles of smaller amplitude that lacked true periodicity. This suggested that the lack of a normal circadian ISR increase had made it impossible for the FDRs to maintain their compensatory insulin hypersecretion beyond 18 h of hyperglycemia. As a result, ISR decreased to the level found in control subjects, and glucose uptake fell below the level of control subjects (61 vs. 117 micromol x kg(-1) x min(-1), P < 0.05). In summary, we found that FDRs with normal glucose tolerance had defects in insulin action and secretion. The newly recognized insulin secretory defect consisted of disruption of the normal circadian ISR cycle, which resulted in reduced insulin secretion (and glucose uptake) during the ascending part of the 24 h ISR cycle.","Insulin secretion is the body's release of insulin, the hormone that helps control blood sugar and metabolism. The objective of this study is to evaluate whether first-degree relatives (a person's parent, sibling, or child) of patients with type 2 diabetes have abnormal 24 hour insulin secretion and, if so, whether this abnormality affected their glucose metabolism. Six African-American first-degree relatives with normal blood sugar level and 12 normal control participants (who had no family history of diabetes) were exposed to 48 hours of hyperglycemic clamping, a technique to keep blood sugar levels stable. Insulin secretion rates (ISRs) are determined by calculating plasma C-peptide levels, which are substances that signal if the body is creating insulin. During the initial hours after giving people infusions of sugar (glucose), insulin secretion rates are about 60% higher in first-degree relatives than in the comparison (control) subjects, while rates of sugar uptake are the same. This finding suggests that the first-degree relatives are insulin resistant, which is when the body doesn't respond well to the insulin hormone and can't use blood sugar for energy. Control subjects have well-defined 24 hour cycles of insulin secretion rates and plasma insulin that increase in the early morning, peak in the afternoon, and decline during the night. In contrast, first-degree relatives have several shorter insulin secretion rate cycles. This suggests that the lack of a normal increase in the 24 hour insulin secretion rate makes it impossible for the first-degree relatives to keep their insulin excess secretion beyond 18 hours of hyperglycemia (high blood sugar). As a result, insulin secretion rate decreased to the level found in control subjects, and blood sugar uptake fell below the level of control subjects. In summary, researchers found that first-degree relatives with normal blood sugar levels had defects in insulin action and secretion. The new insulin secretory defect includes disrupting the normal 24 hour insulin secretion rate cycle, which resulted in reduced insulin secretion (and blood sugar uptake) during the upward part of the 24 hour insulin secretion rate cycle.",1,C

Eleven overweight adults participated in a 4-day randomized crossover study where they ate between 8 am and 2 pm (early TRF (eTRF)) and between 8 am and 8 pm (control schedule). Participants underwent continuous glucose monitoring, and blood was drawn to assess cardiometabolic risk factors, hormones, and gene expression in whole blood cells. Relative to the control schedule, eTRF decreased mean 24-hour glucose levels by 4 ± 1 mg/dl (p = 0.0003) and glycemic excursions by 12 ± 3 mg/dl (p = 0.001). In the morning before breakfast, eTRF increased ketones, cholesterol, and the expression of the stress response and aging gene SIRT1 and the autophagy gene LC3A (all p < 0.04), while in the evening, it tended to increase brain-derived neurotropic factor (BNDF; p = 0.10) and also increased the expression of MTOR (p = 0.007), a major nutrient-sensing protein that regulates cell growth. eTRF also altered the diurnal patterns in cortisol and the expression of several circadian clock genes (p < 0.05). eTRF improves 24-hour glucose levels, alters lipid metabolism and circadian clock gene expression, and may also increase autophagy and have anti-aging effects in humans.","Intermittent fasting is a type of eating schedule where a person doesn't eat any calories for a period of time. Time-restricted feeding is a form of intermittent fasting that involves having a longer daily fasting period. Early studies report that time-restricted feeding improves the health of the heart and metabolism in rodents and humans. In this study, researchers perform the first study to determine how time-restricted feeding affects how information from genes are used, how circulating hormones that travel in blood and attach to cells can change the cell function, and how daily patterns in the heart and metabolism can be risk factors in humans. Eleven overweight adults participated in a 4-day study where they ate between 8 am and 2 pm (early time-restricted feeding) and between 8 am and 8 pm (control group for comparison). Participants have their sugar continuously monitored, and blood is drawn to assess risk factors to the heart and metabolism, hormones, and gene development in blood cells. Relative to the comparison group's schedule, early time-restricted feeding decreased the average 24-hour sugar levels and changes in blood sugar. In the morning before breakfast, early time-restricted feeding increased ketones (substances that the body makes if cells don't get enough blood sugar), cholesterol, and the activity of the stress response and aging gene SIRT1 and the gene LC3A that cleans out damaged cells. While in the evening, time-restricted feeding tends to increase brain-derived neurotropic factor, which is a helpful protein in the spinal cord and brain, and also increases the expansion of the MTOR gene, a major nutrient-sensing protein that regulates cell growth. Early time-restricted feeding changes daily patterns in the cortisol stress hormone and use of several genes. Early time-restricted feeding improves 24 hour blood sugar levels, changes how fats are broken down, and how gene functions are used. Early time-restricted feeding may also increase cleaning of damaged cells and anti-aging effects in humans.",1,C

Clinical trials have shown the benefits of Membrane Lipid Replacement supplements in replenishing damaged membrane lipids and restoring mitochondrial function. These supplements help reduce fatigue in aged subjects and patients with a variety of clinical diagnoses. Recent observations have indicated that Membrane Lipid Replacement can be a useful natural supplement strategy in a variety of conditions. Some of these conditions include chronic fatigue (long-lasting tiredness), chronic infections, and cancers. Membrane Lipid Replacement provides general membrane nutritional support during aging and illness. This improves membrane function and overall health without risk of adverse effects.",1,C
55,23495677,"Background: Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most commonly diagnosed behavioural disorder of childhood, affecting 3-5% of school-age children. The present study investigated whether the supplementation of soy-derived phosphatidylserine (PS), a naturally occurring phospholipid, improves ADHD symptoms in children. Methods: Thirty six children, aged 4-14 years, who had not previously received any drug treatment related to ADHD, received placebo (n = 17) or 200 mg day(-1) PS (n = 19) for 2 months in a randomised, double-blind manner. Main outcome measures included: (i) ADHD symptoms based on DSM-IV-TR; (ii) short-term auditory memory and working memory using the Digit Span Test of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children; and (iii) mental performance to visual stimuli (GO/NO GO task). Results: PS supplementation resulted in significant improvements in: (i) ADHD (P < 0.01), AD (P < 0.01) and HD (P < 0.01); (ii) short-term auditory memory (P < 0.05); and (iii) inattention (differentiation and reverse differentiation, P < 0.05) and inattention and impulsivity (P < 0.05). No significant differences were observed in other measurements and in the placebo group. PS was well-tolerated and showed no adverse effects.

55,28441964,"Background: Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is characterized by unexplained persistent fatigue, commonly accompanied by cognitive dysfunction, sleeping disturbances, orthostatic intolerance, fever, lymphadenopathy, and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The extent to which the gastrointestinal microbiome and peripheral inflammation are associated with ME/CFS remains unclear. We pursued rigorous clinical characterization, fecal bacterial metagenomics, and plasma immune molecule analyses in 50 ME/CFS patients and 50 healthy controls frequency-matched for age, sex, race/ethnicity, geographic site, and season of sampling. Results: Topological analysis revealed associations between IBS co-morbidity, body mass index, fecal bacterial composition, and bacterial metabolic pathways but not plasma immune molecules. IBS co-morbidity was the strongest driving factor in the separation of topological networks based on bacterial profiles and metabolic pathways. Predictive selection models based on bacterial profiles supported findings from topological analyses indicating that ME/CFS subgroups, defined by IBS status, could be distinguished from control subjects with high predictive accuracy. Bacterial taxa predictive of ME/CFS patients with IBS were distinct from taxa associated with ME/CFS patients without IBS. Increased abundance of unclassified Alistipes and decreased Faecalibacterium emerged as the top biomarkers of ME/CFS with IBS; while increased unclassified Bacteroides abundance and decreased Bacteroides vulgatus were the top biomarkers of ME/CFS without IBS. Despite findings of differences in bacterial taxa and metabolic pathways defining ME/CFS subgroups, decreased metabolic pathways associated with unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis and increased atrazine degradation pathways were independent of IBS co-morbidity. Increased vitamin B6 biosynthesis/salvage and pyrimidine ribonucleoside degradation were the top metabolic pathways in ME/CFS without IBS as well as in the total ME/CFS cohort. In ME/CFS subgroups, symptom severity measures including pain, fatigue, and reduced motivation were correlated with the abundance of distinct bacterial taxa and metabolic pathways. Conclusions: Independent of IBS, ME/CFS is associated with dysbiosis and distinct bacterial metabolic disturbances that may influence disease severity. However, our findings indicate that dysbiotic features that are uniquely ME/CFS-associated may be masked by disturbances arising from the high prevalence of IBS co-morbidity in ME/CFS. These insights may enable more accurate diagnosis and lead to insights that inform the development of specific therapeutic strategies in ME/CFS subgroups.","Background: Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is characterized by unexplained persistent fatigue (long-lasting tiredness).

The extent to which the stomach microbiome (gut bacteria) and inflammation (redness and swelling from infection-fighting) are associated (linked) with ME/CFS is unknown. This study evaluated 50 ME/CFS patients and 50 healthy controls. Analysis revealed associations between IBS co-morbidity, body mass index, fecal (poop) bacterial composition, and bacterial metabolic pathways. No associated was found between ME/CFS status and plasma (blood) immune molecules. IBS co-morbidity (co-diagnosis) was the most strongly associated endpoint with ME/CFS status. ME/CFS subgroups, defined by IBS status, could be distinguished from control subjects with high predictive accuracy. Bacterial taxa (bacterial groups) predictive of ME/CFS patients with IBS were distinct from taxa associated with ME/CFS patients without IBS. Two bacteria, Alistipes and Faecalibacterium, emerged as the top biomarkers of ME/CFS with IBS. Two bacteria, Bacteroides and Bacteroides vulgatus, were the top biomarkers of ME/CFS without IBS. Decreased metabolic pathways associated with unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis and increased atrazine (herbicide) degradation pathways were independent of IBS co-morbidity.

55,24473982,"Loss of function in mitochondria, the key organelle responsible for cellular energy production, can result in the excess fatigue and other symptoms that are common complaints in almost every chronic disease. At the molecular level, a reduction in mitochondrial function occurs as a result of the following changes: (1) a loss of maintenance of the electrical and chemical transmembrane potential of the inner mitochondrial membrane, (2) alterations in the function of the electron transport chain, or (3) a reduction in the transport of critical metabolites into mitochondria. In turn, these changes result in a reduced efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation and a reduction in production of adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP). Several components of this system require routine replacement, and this need can be facilitated with natural supplements. Clinical trials have shown the utility of using oral replacement supplements, such as L-carnitine, alpha-lipoic acid (α-lipoic acid [1,2-dithiolane-3-pentanoic acid]), coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10 [ubiquinone]), reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), membrane phospholipids, and other supplements.

55,16935966,"Evidence is put forward to suggest that myalgic encephalomyelitis, also known as chronic fatigue syndrome, may be associated with persistent viral infection. In turn, such infections are likely to impair the ability of the body to biosynthesise n-3 and n-6 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids by inhibiting the delta-6 desaturation of the precursor essential fatty acids--namely, alpha-linolenic acid and linoleic acid. This would, in turn, impair the proper functioning of cell membranes, including cell signalling, and have an adverse effect on the biosynthesis of eicosanoids from the long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid, arachidonic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid. These actions might offer an explanation for some of the symptoms and signs of myalgic encephalomyelitis. A potential therapeutic avenue could be offered by bypassing the inhibition of the enzyme delta-6-desaturase by treatment with virgin cold-pressed non-raffinated evening primrose oil, which would supply gamma-linolenic acid and lipophilic pentacyclic triterpenes, and with eicosapentaenoic acid. The gamma-linolenic acid can readily be converted into dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid and thence arachidonic acid, while triterpenes have important free radical scavenging, cyclo-oxygenase and neutrophil elastase inhibitory activities. Furthermore, both arachidonic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid are, at relatively low concentrations, directly virucidal.","Scientific evidence suggests that myalgic encephalomyelitis, also known as chronic fatigue syndrome or long-lasting tiredness, may be associated with persistent viral infection. These infections may impair the body's ability to biosynthesize (create) fatty acids by inhibiting (blocking) the enzymatic reaction associated with essential fatty acids. This would, in turn, impair the proper functioning of cell membranes (cell boundaries), including cell signaling, and have an adverse effect on the biosynthesis of signaling molecules. These actions might offer an explanation for some of the symptoms and signs of myalgic encephalomyelitis. A potential treatment could be found in virgin cold-pressed primrose oil.

CFS is a multifaceted illness that has many symptoms and a wide array of clinical presentations. As of recent, CFS has been merged with myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME). Much of the difficulty in its management has stemmed from a lack of a concrete understanding of its etiology and pathogenesis. There is a potential association between dysfunction of the autoimmune, neuroendocrine, or autonomic nervous systems and the development of CFS. Possible triggering events, such as infections followed by an immune dysregulation resulting have also been proposed. In fact, ME/CFS was first described following Epstein Barr virus (EBV) infections, but it was later determined that it was not always preceded by EBV infection. Patient diagnosed with CFS have shown a noticeably earlier activation of anaerobic metabolism as a source of energy, which is suggestive of impaired oxygen consumption. The differential diagnoses range from tick-borne illnesses to psychiatric disorders to thyroid gland dysfunction. Given the many overlapping symptoms of CFS with other illnesses makes diagnosing it far from an easy task. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) considers it a diagnosing of exclusion, stating that self-reported fatigue for at minimum of six months and four of the following symptoms are necessary for a proper diagnosis: memory problems, sore throat, post-exertion malaise, tender cervical or axillary lymph nodes, myalgia, multi-joint pain, headaches, and troubled sleep. In turn, management of CFS is just as difficult. Treatment ranges from conservative, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and antidepressants, to minimally invasive management.

56,20301638,"Clinical characteristics: Pallister-Hall syndrome (referred to as PHS in this entry) is characterized by a spectrum of anomalies ranging from polydactyly, asymptomatic bifid epiglottis, and hypothalamic hamartoma at the mild end to laryngotracheal cleft with neonatal lethality at the severe end. Individuals with mild PHS may be incorrectly diagnosed as having isolated postaxial polydactyly type A. Individuals with PHS can have pituitary insufficiency and may die as neonates from undiagnosed and untreated adrenal insufficiency. Diagnosis/testing: The diagnosis of Pallister-Hall syndrome can be established in a proband with both hypothalamic hamartoma and mesoaxial polydactyly. Identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in GLI3 confirms the diagnosis. Management: Treatment of manifestations: Urgent treatment for endocrine abnormalities, especially cortisol deficiency; management of epiglottic abnormalities depending on the abnormality and the extent of respiratory compromise. Bifid epiglottis, the most common abnormality, typically does not need treatment. Standard treatment of anal atresia or stenosis; symptomatic treatment of seizures; elective repair of polydactyly; developmental intervention or special education for developmental delays. Prevention of secondary complications: Biopsy or resection of hypothalamic hamartoma may result in complications and lifelong need for hormone replacement; seizures may begin or worsen with use of stimulants for attention deficit disorder. Surveillance: During childhood, annual developmental assessment and annual medical evaluation to assess growth and monitor for signs of precocious puberty. Genetic counseling: Pallister-Hall syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.  Individuals with PHS may have an affected parent or may have the disorder as the result of a de novo pathogenic variant. About 25% of individuals have a de novo pathogenic variant. Persons with a de novo pathogenic variant are generally more severely affected than those with a family history of PHS. The risk to offspring of an affected individual is 50%. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible if the pathogenic variant in the family is known. The reliability of ultrasound examination for prenatal diagnosis is unknown.","Pallister-Hall syndrome (PHS) ranges from mild to severe cases. Mild cases include polydactyly, in which people have six fingers or toes, a harmless split in the epiglottis (a small leaf-shaped structure that prevents food and drink from entering the windpipe) and hypothalamic hamartoma, a noncancerous growth in the base of the brain that can cause seizures and other problems. The severe cases include laryngotracheal cleft, a defect in which the baby's airway and food passages are connected, which can lead to newborn's death if the food and saliva get into the lungs. Mild PHS might be confused with babies having one or more extra finger or toe at birth, called postaxial polydactyly type A. In people with PHS pituitary gland, located in the brain, might not produce enough hormones (substances that regulate growth, metabolism and other functions). People with PHS may have adrenal insufficiency, a condition in which the adrenal glands do not produce enough hormones to control blood pressure, metabolism and the immune system. If these conditions are not recognized and treated in newborns, they may die. Hypothalamic hamartoma (non-cancer growth in the brain) and extra fingers or toes may be caused by Pallister-Hall syndrome. Genetic testing confirms the patients have PHS. Urgent treatments are needed if the glands do not produce enough hormones, especially cortisol. The defect in the flap that covers the windpipe needs treatment if it can lead to problems with breathing. Bifid epiglottis, the split in the flap that covers the windpipe, typically does not need treatment. Standard treatments are used for problems with anus, such as narrowing of the anal canal. Patients can choose to repair extra fingers. Seizures are treated as needed. Special education and other support are provided for developmental delays. Treatments of the problems caused by PHS can have complications. After surgery for the hypothalamic hamartoma patients may need to take hormones for the rest of their life. Drugs for attention deficit disorder may cause or worsen seizures. Every year, children with PHS need evaluation of their mental development, growth, and signs of their body changing into that of an adult (puberty) too soon. Either parent passes down the disease. A child will have PHS if either parent passes down the disease or if a new variant develops before birth. About a quarter of the PHS patients have a new harmful variant. Persons with a new harmful variant have a more severe disease than those with a family history of PHS. Chances of getting or not getting the disease from the parent are equal. If the harmful variant runs in the family, the developing baby may be tested during pregnancy. It is not known if ultrasound during pregnancy will show PHS.",2,C

Its signs are six fingers and toes, shortened or split flap that protects the windpipe, problems with the organs in the chest and belly, non-cancer mass in the brain that often causes problems with pituitary gland, which regulates body functions and growth. Signs of PHS in different patients are very different. PHS ranges from mild with good outcomes to severe that can lead to death of the newborns. We describe a two-year-old girl with deformities of the face, hand and feet and dwarfism. PHS was diagnosed on the basis of the presented symptoms and genetic tests. Abnormalities, such as the presence of extra or fewer than five fingers or toes, are associated with disorders of the endocrine system, which includes the glands that regulate body functions through chemicals called hormones. Quick and correct diagnosis would help in planning treatment for the child and advise the family regarding the next pregnancy of the child's mother. ",2,C
56,26768579,"Pallister-Hall syndrome was initially recognized under fairly unique circumstances involving exhumation of the very first case. The first two cases had dramatic and unusual features including a hypothalamic hamartoblastoma, imperforate anus, an unusual type of polydactyly with the extra digit being central, hypopituitarism with secondary hypoadrenalism, and lethality after birth (probably due to hypoadrenalism). Within a short time frame, four additional cases were identified.  As the full spectrum and variability of anomalies was recognized, it became clear that it was not such a rare disorder. Shortly after familial cases were recognized, the responsible gene was identified at GLI3. However, since other different conditions also involved GLI3, elaborating the domains of the gene and the types of mutations needed to be defined in order to have a clear correlation of the genotype-phenotype relations.","Pallister-Hall syndrome was first identified in unearthed human remains. The first two bodies had unusual features including a brain mass, missing anus, a sixth finger in the center, and death after birth. As more cases were found, it became clear that PHS is not such a rare disorder. Shortly after, it was recognized that the disease runs in the families due to changes in the gene called GLI3. Other problems can be caused by changes in the same gene GLI3. Different changes in the different parts of the gene cause different problems.",2,C
56,26604140,"Pallister-Hall syndrome (PHS) is a rare disorder caused by mutations in GLI3 that produce a transcriptional repressor (GLI3R). Individuals with PHS present with a variably penetrant variety of urogenital system malformations, including renal aplasia or hypoplasia, hydroureter, hydronephrosis or a common urogenital sinus. The embryologic mechanisms controlled by GLI3R that result in these pathologic phenotypes are undefined. We demonstrate that germline expression of GLI3R causes renal hypoplasia, associated with decreased nephron number, and hydroureter and hydronephrosis, caused by blind-ending ureters. Mice with obligate GLI3R expression also displayed duplication of the ureters that was caused by aberrant common nephric duct patterning and ureteric stalk outgrowth. These developmental abnormalities are associated with suppressed Hedgehog signaling activity in the cloaca and adjacent vesicular mesenchyme. Mice with conditional expression of GLI3R were utilized to identify lineage-specific effects of GLI3R. In the ureteric bud, GLI3R expression decreased branching morphogenesis. In Six2-positive nephrogenic progenitors, GLI3R decreased progenitor cell proliferation reducing the number of nephrogenic precursor structures. Using mutant mice with Gli3R and Gli3 null alleles, we demonstrate that urogenital system patterning and development is controlled by the levels of GLI3R and not by an absence of full-length GLI3. We conclude that the urogenital system phenotypes observed in PHS are caused by GLI3R-dependent perturbations in nephric duct patterning, renal branching morphogenesis and nephrogenic progenitor self-renewal.","Pallister-Hall syndrome (PHS) is a rare disorder caused by changes in the gene called GLI3. Patients with PHS have a variety of problems with reproduction and urinary organs, including poor development of the kidneys, backup of urine in the duct between the kidney and the bladder, swelling of the kidneys, or a shared opening for the birth canal and the urinary tract. It is not known how the specific problems arise We show that variations in the GLI3 gene cause poor development of the kidneys, and a closed end in the duct that runs between the kidney and the bladder, which causes swelling of the kidneys and the duct. Mice with the same change in the GLI3 gene also had two ducts that connected a kidney to the bladder The abnormal development is caused by the lack of information the embryonic cells (cells that forms when eggs are fertilized) need for proper development.   Using mutant mice, we show that the development of the reproduction and urinary organs is controlled by the variants in the GLI3 gene. Different problems in PHS are caused by the different mistakes in the development of the urinary organs due to the information provided by the variants of the GLI3 gene.",2,C
56,15617553,"Pallister-Hall syndrome (PHS) is a rare, single-gene, malformation syndrome that includes central polydactyly, hypothalamic hamartoma, bifid epiglottis, endocrine dysfunction, and other anomalies. The syndrome has variable clinical manifestations and is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. We sought to determine whether psychiatric disorders and/or neuropsychological impairment were characteristic of PHS. We prospectively conducted systematic neuropsychiatric evaluations with 19 PHS subjects ranging in age from 7 to 75 years. The evaluation included detailed clinical interviews, clinician-rated and self-report instruments, and a battery of neuropsychological tests. Seven of 14 adult PHS subjects met diagnostic criteria for at least one DSM-IV Axis I disorder. Three additional subjects demonstrated developmental delays and/or neuropsychological deficits on formal neuropsychological testing. However, we found no characteristic psychiatric phenotype associated with PHS, and the frequency of each of the diagnoses observed in these subjects was not different from that expected in this size sample. The overall frequency of psychiatric findings among all patients with PHS cannot be compared to point prevalence estimates of psychiatric disease in the general population because of biased ascertainment.  This limitation is inherent to the study of behavioral phenotypes in rare disorders.  The general issue of psychiatric evaluation of rare genetic syndromes is discussed in light of this negative result.","Pallister-Hall syndrome (PHS) is a rare disease caused by changes in a single gene (the basic unit of inheritance.) The abnormalities include extra fingers and toes, growth of non-cancer masses in the brain, changes in the flap that protect the windpipe, improper function of the endocrine system that regulates body functions through hormones, and other problems. The signs of this disease vary and are passed down through either parent. We studied if PHS causes any mental health problems. We measured how well the brain is working in 19 PHS patients ranging in age from 7 to 75 years. The evaluation included clinical examination, patients' reports and tests of brain functions. Seven of 14 adults had at least one of the mental health conditions most commonly found in the public. Three other patients had delays in mental development or low scores on the tests that measure how well the brain is working. The tests usually evaluate reading, use of language, attention, learning, reasoning, remembering, problem-solving, and more. We did not find mental health problems specifically associated with PHS. The frequency of each of the problems in these patients was the same as expected in the group of 19 people. The rate of mental problems in PHS cannot be compared to the overall rate of mental problems in the general population because of the way this study collected the data. ",2,C
56,3146300,"We report on three infants with hand anomalies and congenital hypopituitarism. In two of the cases, a hypothalamic tumor was found; the third infant died without postmortem brain studies. Family history in the first case suggested possible familial recurrence; the mother's sister had died at 17 hr of age with polydactyly, microglossia, and flat nasal bridge (no autopsy done). Our second case was born by cesarean section after a pregnancy complicated by extremely low maternal estriols. At birth, hypopituitarism was diagnosed, a cranial CT scan was read as normal, and hormonal replacement was begun with thyroxine, hydrocortisone, and growth hormone. At 11.5 mo of age she developed seizures; and a repeat CT scan showed a mass extending beneath the hypothalamus. This tumor was removed surgically at 12 mo, the first successful treatment of this disorder. Our third possible case had a bifid epiglottis, hypopituitarism, and hand anomalies. A CT scan at birth failed to reveal a mass in the hypothalamus. This child died from complications of untreated hypopituitarism, and no neuropathology studies were done. These three cases were conceived between March 10th and April 17th in three different years in three geographically contiguous counties of Vermont. Clustering in time and space and possible familial recurrence, in one of these cases, suggest a possible gene/environment interaction.","We report on three infants born with hands born with hand defects and defects of the pituitary gland, which regulates body functions and growth through chemical substances called hormones. Two of the newborns had hypothalamic tumors (noncancerous growths in the base of their brains). The brain of the third newborn was not examined. In one case, the disease runs in the family. The mother's sister died at the age of 17. She had extra fingers, extremely small tongue, and flat nose. The mother of the second newborn had very low levels of estriol, a hormone made during pregnancy that is used to measure the unborn baby's health. When this baby was born, brain imaging was normal, but the levels of hormones that regulate growth and development were low. Treatment with growth and other hormones was started. At 11.5 months the baby started having seizures. A new brain imaging showed a mass in the lower part of the brain. Surgery to remove this mass at 12 months was the first successful treatment of this disorder. The third newborn had a split in the flap that protects the windpipe, lack of hormones that regulate growth and development, and abnormal hands. Brain imaging at birth did not show a mass in the lower part of the brain. This child died from complications of a brain mass that was not showing in the image. These three babies were conceived between March 10th and April 17th in three different years in three neighboring counties of Vermont.

56,9054938,"Pallister-Hall syndrome (PHS, M146510) was first described in 1980 in six newborns. It is a pleiotropic disorder of human development that comprises hypothalamic hamartoma, central polydactyly, and other malformations. This disorder is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait and has been mapped to 7p13 (S. Kang et al.Autosomal dominant Pallister-Hall syndrome maps to 7p13. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 59, A81 (1996)), co-localizing the PHS locus and the GLI3 zinc finger transcription factor gene. Large deletions or translocations resulting in haploinsufficiency of the GLI3 gene have been associated with Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome (GCPS; M175700) although no mutations have been identified in GCPS patients with normal karyotypes. Both PHS and GCPS have polysyndactyly, abnormal craniofacial features and are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, but they are clinically distinct. The polydactyly of GCPS is commonly preaxial and that of PHS is typically central or postaxial. No reported cases of GCPS have hypothalamic hamartoma and PHS does not cause hypertelorism or broadening of the nasal root or forehead. The co-localization of the loci for PHS and GCPS led us to investigate GLI3 as a candidate gene for PHS. Herein we report two PHS families with frameshift mutations in GLI3 that are 3' of the zinc finger-encoding domains, including one family with a de novo mutation. These data implicate mutations in GLI3 as the cause of autosomal dominant PHS, and suggest that frameshift mutations of the GLI3 transcription factor gene can alter the development of multiple organ systems in vertebrates.","Pallister-Hall syndrome (PHS) was first described in 1980 in six newborns. It is caused by a single gene that is involved in development of multiple body parts. The problems include a non-cancer mass in the lower part of the brain and extra fingers and toes, among others. This disorder is passed down by either parent, and the involved gene is located on chromosome 7, associating PHS with the gene called GLI3. Variants of the the GLI3 gene in which some genetic information is missing or misplaced are associated with Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome (GCPS) that affects development of the hands, feet, head, and face. Patients with both PHS and GCPS have extra or merged fingers and toes, and abnormal heads and faces. Both PHS and GCPS are passed down from either parent, but the clinical signs of these diseases are different. The additional finger in GCPS is usually located next to the thumb. In PHS, the extra finger is in the center or next to the little finger (pinky). The extra toes follow the same pattern: in GCPS the sixth toe is next to the big toe. No reported cases of GCPS have non-cancer growth in the lower part of the brain, and PHS does not cause increased distance between the eyes or broadening of the nose or forehead. Because the generic changes for PHS and GCPS share the location on the chromosome, we study GLI3 as a gene potentially responsible for PHS. We describe two PHS families with large changes in the GLI3 gene. In one family the change is new and there is no family history of PHS. The data show that changes in the GLI3 gene, which are passed down in the family or happen for the first time, cause PHS. Large-scale changes in the GLI3 gene can change the development of many tissues and organs.",2,C
57,31098348,"Trigeminal neuralgia is caused by compression of trigeminal nerve root and it leads to demyelination gradually. It was almost idiopathic and occurred unexpected. The upper cervical spinal cord contains the spinal trigeminal tract and nucleus. Fibers with cell bodies in the trigeminal ganglion enter in the upper pons and descend caudally to C2 level. We experienced a rare patient with facial pain, which was paroxysmal attack with severe pain after a clear event, cervical spinal injury (C2). So, this case reminds us of a possible cause of trigeminal neuralgia after a trauma of the head and neck.","Trigeminal nerve pain (neuralgia) is caused by pressure on the trigeminal (meaning ""threefold"", for the three branches of the nerve) nerve. The pressure leads to gradual loss of the protecting layer that covers the nerve. It arises spontaneously and unexpected. The spinal cord is the bundle of nerve tissues that connects the brain with the body. In the upper neck region, it contains parts of the trigeminal nerve. The trigeminal nerve cells and fibers enter the brainstem, the bottom part of the brain connected to the spinal cord, and go down to the second vertebrae at the top of the cervical spine. A rare patient had severe repeated bouts of facial pain after an injury to the second vertebrae at the top of the neck region. This patient reminds us that trigeminal neuralgia may be caused by injuries to the head and neck. ",2,C
57,29030173,"Objective: To report a novel wireless neuromodulation system for treatment of refractory craniofacial pain. Background: Previous studies utilizing peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) of the occipital and trigeminal nerves reported positive outcomes for alleviating neuropathic pain localized to the craniofacial and occipital areas. However several technological limitations and cosmetic concerns inhibited a more widespread acceptance and use of neuromodulation. Also, a relatively high incidence of adverse events like electrode erosions, dislocation, wire fracture and/or infection at the surgical site mandates a change in our approach to neuromodulation technology and implant techniques in the craniofacial region. Methods: We report a novel approach for the management of craniofacial pain with a wirelessly powered, minimally invasive PNS system. The system is percutaneously implanted and placed subcutaneously adjacent to affected facial nerves via visual guidance by the clinician. In this feasibility study, pilot evidence was gathered in a cohort of ten subjects suffering from a combination of chronic headaches, facial pain for at least 15 days per month and for at least 4h/day. Results: At four weeks post-implant follow up, all patients reported sustained pain relief of the primary pain area. Electrode location and total number of electrodes used per subject varied across the cohort. The average pain reduction using the visual analog scale was ≥82%. The procedure had no adverse events or side effects. Conclusion: Percutaneous placement of a wireless neurostimulation device directly adjacent to affected craniofacial nerve(s) is a minimally invasive and reversible method of pain control in patients with craniofacial pain refractory to conventional medical managements. Preliminary results are encouraging and further larger scale studies are required for improved applications.","This study presents a new wireless nerve stimulation system for treatment of uncontrollable pain of the head and face. Previous studies reported that stimulation of the nerves called trigeminal (meaning ""threefold"", for the three branches of the nerve) and occipital (relating to the back of the head) reduces pain in the head and face. Due to the shortcomings of the devices and concerns about the appearance, the nerve stimulation systems are not used widely.  The relatively common complications are worn and broken wires, devices moving from the original placement, and infection around the device. To avoid these complications, we need to change the nerve stimulation systems and the way they are implanted (placed) in the head and face. We describe a new peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) system for treatment of pain in the head and neck. The system is wireless and is placed using small cuts and few stitches. The doctors place the system under the skin, next to the damaged facial nerves This study included ten patients who experienced chronic headaches and facial pain for four or more hours a day and at least 15 days a month. Four weeks after the systems were implanted, all patients felt continuing ain relief. The patients had different numbers of wires and implant locations. On average, patients felt five times less pain after treatment. There were no complications Placing a wireless nerve stimulation device under the skin next to the damaged nerves in the head and neck reduces pain that is hard to control otherwise. This treatment is gentle and can be reversed. ",2,C
57,7670427,"Traumatic injury to the peripheral nerves often results in persistent discomfort. Substance P has been implicated as a mediator of pain, and depletion of this neurotransmitter has been shown to reduce pain. Subjects suffering from traumatic dysesthesia of the trigeminal nerve were treated with capsaicin, a substance P depleter with significant long-term effects. This form of therapy may be used individually or in combination with other pharmacologic interventions in the treatment of traumatic trigeminal dysesthesia.","After peripheral nerves (the parts of the nervous system outside the brain and spinal cord) are injured, people often feel discomfort for a long time. A chemical called Substance P is involved in the process of feeling pain. Lowering the amount of this chemical involved in the transmission of nerve signals lessens pain. Capsaicin was a good long-term treatment for people who experienced an unpleasant abnormal sensation after injury to the trigeminal nerve. Trigeminal nerve is a large, three-part nerve in the head that provides sensation. Capsaicin is a chemical that lowers the amount of Substance P in the body. Drugs that lower the amount of Substance P in the body may be used alone or together with other medications to treat traumatic trigeminal dysesthesia (an unpleasant abnormal sensation after injury to the trigeminal nerve.)",2,C
57,34753868,"The current understanding of ON is that it causes neuropathic pain in the distribution of the greater occipital nerve, the lesser occipital nerve, the third occipital nerve or a combination of the 3. It is currently a subset of headaches although there is some debate if ON should be its own condition. Occipital neuralgia causes chronic, sharp, stabbing pain in the upper neck, back of the head, and behind the ears that can radiate to the front of the head. Diagnosis is typically clinical and patients present with intermittent, painful episodes associated with the occipital region and the nerves described above. Most cases are unilateral pain, however bilateral pain can be present and the pain can radiate to the frontal region and face. Physical examination is the first step in management of this disease and patients may demonstrate tenderness over the greater occipital and lesser occipital nerves. Anesthetics like 1% to 2% lidocaine or 0.25% to 0.5% bupivacaine can be used to block these nerves and anti-inflammatory drugs like corticosteroids can be used in combination to prevent compressive symptoms. Other treatments like botulinum toxin and radiofrequency ablation have shown promise and require more research. Surgical decompression through resection of the obliquus capitis inferior is the definitive treatment however there are significant risks associated with this procedure.","Occipital Neuralgia is the pain in the occipital nerves, the nerves that run from the top of the spinal cord up in the back of the head. It is considered a type of headaches, but some doctors suggest pain in the nerves in the back of the head is a different problem. Occipital neuralgia is a continuing, sharp, stabbing pain in the upper neck, back of the head, and behind the ears. It can also extend to the front of the head. The doctors decide the patients have the disease if the pain in the back of the patients' heads comes and goes. Most patients have pain on one side of their head, but the pain could also be on both sides and extend to the front of the head and face. When the doctors examine the patients, the patients' skin over the nerves in the back of the head may be tender. Drugs like lidocaine can block the feeling of pain in these nerves. Drugs that reduce inflammation, such as steroids may be added to keep the signs from happening. Other treatments like botulinum toxin that blocks the nerve signals and radiofrequency ablation that uses radio waves to shrink tissues may be promising but need to be studied more.  Surgeons may permanently relieve the pressure on the nerve by removing a small muscle between the neck vertebra at the base of the head, but this treatment is risky. ",2,C

57,33853065,"Introduction: Facial pain (FP) is a type of neuropathic pain which recognizes both central and peripheral causes. It can be difficult to treat because it can often become resistant to pharmacological treatments. Motor Cortex Stimulation (MCS) has been used in selected cases, but the correct indications of MCS in FP have not been fully established. Here we systematically reviewed the literature regarding MCS in FP analysing the results of this technique and studying the possible role of different factors in the prognosis of these patients. Methods: A literature search was performed through different databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Embase) according to PRISMA guidelines using the following terms in any possible combination: ""facial pain"" or ""trigeminal"" or ""anaesthesia dolorosa"" and ""motor cortex stimulation."" Results: 111 articles were reviewed, and 12 studies were included in the present analysis for a total of 108 patients. Overall, at latest follow-up (FU), 70.83% of patients responded to MCS. The preoperative VAS significantly decreased at the latest FU (8.83 ± 1.17 and 4.31 ± 2.05, respectively; p < 0.0001). Younger age (p = 0.0478) and a peripheral FP syndrome (p = 0.0006) positively affected the definitive implantation rate on univariate analysis. Younger age emerged as a factor strongly associated to a higher probability to go to a definitive MCS implant on multivariate analysis (p = 0.0415). Conclusion: Our results evidenced the effectiveness of MCS in treating FP. Moreover, the younger age emerged as a positive prognostic factor for definitive implantation. Further studies with longer FU are needed to better evaluate the long-term results of MCS.","Facial pain is nerve pain caused by nerves in the spinal cord and outside the spinal cord and brain.

We review what is known about treating patients with facial pain using MCS and the outcomes of the treatment. We found information about 108 patients. MCS helped almost three quarters of the patients. The patients felt their pain was reduced almost to half of the pain they felt before surgery. The treatment was more effective in younger patients and those with pain on the side of the face. Younger patients were more likely to get MCS implanted devices MCS is an effective treatment for facial pain. Younger patients were more likely to get permanent implanted devices. ",2,C
57,33185371,"Background: Neuropathic facial pain occurs due to pathologic dysfunctions of a nerve responsible for mediating sensory fibers to the head. Surgical interventions, in cases of failed medical therapy, include microvascular decompression, radiofrequency (RF) ablation, percutaneous balloon decompression, and stereotactic radiosurgery. In this review, we focused on RF ablation as a treatment for chronic facial pain. Objectives: The objective of this review was to summarize available evidence behind RF ablation for facial pain, including pain outcome measures, secondary outcomes, and complications. Study design: Systematic review. Setting: This systematic review examined studies that applied the use of RF ablation for management of facial pain. Methods: This systematic review was reported following the guidelines outlined in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Two reviewers independently scored the methodological quality of the selected studies. Due to heterogeneity of studies, a best-evidence synthesis of the available prognostic factors was provided. Results: We reviewed 44 studies and assessed their short- and long-term pain relief measurements, as well as secondary outcomes including patient satisfaction, quality of life improvements, decrease in oral medication use, and recurrence rates. Maximal pain relief was achieved in treatment groups using combined continuous radiofrequency (CRF) and pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) therapies, followed by CRF therapy alone and finally PRF therapy alone. All treatment regimens improved secondary outcomes. Common complications of treatment included facial numbness, masseter weakness, cheek hematomas, diminished corneal reflex, and dry eyes. Limitations: A large variability in definitions of trigeminal neuralgia, RF technique, and patient selection bias was observed in our selected cohort of studies. In addition, there was a paucity of strong longitudinal randomized controlled trials and prospective studies. Conclusions: This systematic review found evidence that RF ablation is efficient in treating patients with facial pain, as well as in improving quality of life and reducing oral medication use. Maximal pain control is achieved using combined CRF and PRF therapy. Complications are uncommon and include facial numbness, masseter weakness, cheek hematomas, diminished corneal reflex, and dry eyes.","Neural facial pain is caused by the nerves that transmit sensation to the head. If medicines do not help, surgery may be used. Surgeries relieve compressed nerves (microvascular decompression); or shrink tissues using radio waves (radiofrequency (RF) ablation) or local radiation (stereotactic radiosurgery). Other surgeries prevent the nerve from transmitting signals (percutaneous balloon decompression.) We discuss using radio waves (RF ablation) to treat chronic facial pain. We summarize what is known about RF ablation for facial pain, including treatment results and complications.   We summarize the pain relief results, patient satisfaction, quality of life, decrease in the drug use, and how often the pain returns. Combining two different types of radio wave treatments (continuous radiofrequency (CRF) and pulsed radiofrequency (PRF))reduced pain the best. CRF treatment was second best, followed by PRF.

57,32918059,"Introduction: The complex nature of facial pain conditions creates a diagnostic challenge which may necessitate specialist referral. Aim: To identify the case mix presenting to a specialist tertiary care facial pain clinic.  Methods: A retrospective review of 112 patient records was undertaken. Trends in provisional diagnoses from referrers and the correlation to diagnoses made following specialist consultation were reviewed. Results: The most common provisional diagnoses recorded in referral letters were painful temporomandibular disorders, trigeminal neuralgia and persistent idiopathic facial pain (PIFP). Over a quarter of referrals did not include a provisional diagnosis. Following assessment, only one case was not given a definitive diagnosis and no patients were diagnosed with PIFP. A causative factor was identified in all the initially queried PIFP cases, and painful post-traumatic trigeminal neuropathic pain was found in multiple patients. Conclusions: Painful post-traumatic trigeminal neuropathic pain should be considered if pain onset coincides with dental treatment or other traumatic events. PIFP is a rare facial pain diagnosis and may be over-diagnosed by dental and medical practitioners. It is important to systematically exclude other causes before reaching this diagnosis. This will facilitate effective treatment, manage patient expectations and potentially reduce unnecessary referrals.",Facial pain may be hard to recognize and a specialist might need to examine the patient. The study's aim was to identify the mix of patient cases at a specialist facial pain clinic. We reviewed the records of 112 patients who visited the specialists at the facial pain clinic. We compared the reasons for specialist consultation given by the primary doctors to the diagnoses made by the specialists. Most often the primary doctors thought the patients' pain was caused by problems with the temporomandibular joints that connect the lower jaw to the skull; pain in the trigeminal nerve that sends signals about sensations in the face to the brain; and other facial pain. Over a quarter of patients referred to the cliniic had no diagnosis. The specialist could not diagnose only one patient and have not diagnosed any patients with unspecified facial pain. The specialists found causes of all previously unspecified facial pain. Many patients had trigeminal nerve pain following an injury (Painful post-traumatic trigeminal neuropathic pain ). Painful post-traumatic trigeminal neuropathic pain should be considered if pain started after dental treatment or injury. Unspecified facial pain is rare and may be overused by dentists and physicians. All other causes should be excluded before diagnosis of the unspecified facial pain. This will improve treatment and patients' expectations. It may reduce unnecessary referrals.,2,C
57,32791919,"Introduction: Trigeminal neuralgia is an exemplary neuropathic pain condition characterized by paroxysmal electric-shock-like pain. However, up to 50% of patients also experiences concomitant continuous pain. In this neuroimaging study, we aimed to identify the specific anatomical features of trigeminal nerve root in patients with concomitant continuous pain. Methods: We enrolled 73 patients with a definitive diagnosis of classical and idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia and 40 healthy participants. The diagnosis of trigeminal neuralgia was independently confirmed by two clinicians. Patients were grouped as patients with purely paroxysmal pain (45 patients) and patients also with concomitant continuous pain (28 patients). All participants underwent a structured clinical examination and a 3T MRI with sequences dedicated to the anatomical study of the trigeminal nerve root, including volumetric study. Images analysis was independently performed by two investigators, blinded to any clinical data. Results: In most patients with concomitant continuous pain, this type of pain, described as burning, throbbing or aching, manifested at the disease onset. Demographic and clinical variables did not differ between the two groups of patients; the frequency of neurovascular compression and nerve dislocation were similar. Conversely, trigeminal nerve root atrophy was more severe in patients with concomitant continuous pain than in those with purely paroxysmal pain (p = 0.006). Conclusions: Our clinical and neuroimaging study found that in patients with trigeminal neuralgia, concomitant continuous pain was associated with trigeminal nerve root atrophy, therefore suggesting that this type of pain is likely related to axonal loss and abnormal activity in denervated trigeminal second-order neurons.","Neuralgia is pain in the nerves that feels as bursts of electric-shock-like pain. Up tp half of the patients also experience continuous pain. We study the specific anatomical features of trigeminal nerve root (a part of the nerve that helps the face recognize pain, touch, heat and cold sensations, as well as chewing. We studied patients with continuous pain. We studied 73 patients with trigeminal neuralgia (nerve pain) and 40 healthy participants. The diagnosis of trigeminal neuralgia was independently confirmed by two clinicians. 45 patients had only Burts of pain and 28 patients had continuous pain along with the bursts. All patients had clinical examination and MRI. Two specialists studied the images without losing at the clinical data. In most patients with continuous pain it started as burning, throbbing or aching sensation. The patients in the two groups and the frequency and location of the nerve damage signs in these patients were similar On the contrary, patients with both the bursts and continuous pain had more atrophy ((decrease in size) of the trigeminal nerve than the patients with bursts only. Clinical examination of patients with trigeminal nerve pain and their medical images show that patients who experienced continuous pain along with pain bursts lost some nerve tissues. This type of pain is related to wrong signaling in the nerve that lost tissues. ",2,C
57,31688325,"Orofacial pain syndromes encompass several clinically defined and classified entities. The focus here is on the role of clinical neurophysiologic and psychophysical tests in the diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and pathophysiological mechanisms of definite trigeminal neuropathic pain and other chronic orofacial pain conditions (excluding headache and temporomandibular disorders). The International Classification of Headache Disorders 2018 classifies these facial pain disorders under the heading Painful cranial neuropathies and other facial pains. In addition to unambiguous painful posttraumatic or postherpetic trigeminal neuropathies, burning mouth syndrome, persistent idiopathic facial and dental pain, and trigeminal neuralgia have also been identified with neurophysiologic and quantitative sensory testing to involve the nervous system. Despite normal clinical examination, these all include clusters of patients with evidence for either peripheral or central nervous system pathology compatible with the subclinical end of a continuum of trigeminal neuropathic pain conditions. Useful tests in the diagnostic process include electroneuromyography with specific needle, neurography techniques for the inferior alveolar and infraorbital nerves, brain stem reflex recordings (blink reflex with stimulation of the supraorbital, infraorbital, mental, and lingual nerves; jaw jerk; masseter silent period), evoked potential recordings, and quantitative sensory testing. Habituation of the blink reflex and evoked potential responses to repeated stimuli evaluate top-down inhibition, and navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation allows the mapping of reorganization within the motor cortex in chronic neuropathic pain. With systematic use of neurophysiologic and quantitative sensory testing, many of the current ambiguities in the diagnosis, classification, and understanding of chronic orofacial syndromes can be clarified for clinical practice and future research.","Orofacial pain syndromes are diseases known to cause pain in the face and mouth. We discuss clinical examinations of the neural system that help identifying trigeminal nerve pain and other chronic facial pain conditions, but not headaches and problems with TMJ. The International Classification of Headache Disorders 2018 classifies these facial pain disorders under the heading Painful cranial neuropathies and other facial pains. Clinical examinations of the nervous system help identifying painful conditions of the trigeminal nerve, which carries sensation from the face to the brain. These conditions may start after an injury (posttraumatic trigeminal neuropathy) or herpes infection (postherpetic trigeminal neuropathy). Other related conditions are burning mouth syndrome (a burning, scalding, or tingling feeling in the mouth) and persistent idiopathic facial and dental pain, which is described as continuing pain in the face and teeth of unknown cause. Even patients who appear normal on clinical examination have damage to their nervous system that can cause trigeminal nerve pain. Diagnostic tests include recording electrical signals in the muscles (electroneuromyography), MRI of the nerves around the eyes, blink reflexes and jaw jerk when different nerves are stimulated, recording electrical signals after the nerves are stimulated, and tests for pain sensation. Responsiveness of the blink reflex and records of the electrical signals after repeated nerve stimulation show if the response is suppressed. Medical imaging called navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation shows the areas of the brain that change due to chronic nerve pain. Consistent use of the above tests will help understanding the chronic facial pain conditions. ",2,C
59,35081293,"Background: Although the three vaccines against coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) that have received emergency use authorization in the United States are highly effective, breakthrough infections are occurring. Data are needed on the serial use of homologous boosters (same as the primary vaccine) and heterologous boosters (different from the primary vaccine) in fully vaccinated recipients. Methods: In this phase 1-2, open-label clinical trial conducted at 10 sites in the United States, adults who had completed a Covid-19 vaccine regimen at least 12 weeks earlier and had no reported history of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection received a booster injection with one of three vaccines: mRNA-1273 (Moderna) at a dose of 100 μg, Ad26.COV2.S (Johnson & Johnson-Janssen) at a dose of 5×1010 virus particles, or BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) at a dose of 30 μg. The primary end points were safety, reactogenicity, and humoral immunogenicity on trial days 15 and 29. Results: Of the 458 participants who were enrolled in the trial, 154 received mRNA-1273, 150 received Ad26.COV2.S, and 153 received BNT162b2 as booster vaccines; 1 participant did not receive the assigned vaccine. Reactogenicity was similar to that reported for the primary series. More than half the recipients reported having injection-site pain, malaise, headache, or myalgia. For all combinations, antibody neutralizing titers against a SARS-CoV-2 D614 G pseudovirus increased by a factor of 4 to 73, and binding titers increased by a factor of 5 to 55. Homologous boosters increased neutralizing antibody titers by a factor of 4 to 20, whereas heterologous boosters increased titers by a factor of 6 to 73. Spike-specific T-cell responses increased in all but the homologous Ad26.COV2.S-boosted subgroup. CD8+ T-cell levels were more durable in the Ad26.COV2.S-primed recipients, and heterologous boosting with the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine substantially increased spike-specific CD8+ T cells in the mRNA vaccine recipients. Conclusions: Homologous and heterologous booster vaccines had an acceptable safety profile and were immunogenic in adults who had completed a primary Covid-19 vaccine regimen at least 12 weeks earlier.","The three vaccines against coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) work well and fewer vaccinated people get sick. Breakthrough infections still sometimes happen, which means vaccinated people may get sick. We need data on the use of the same booster and boosters that are different from the primary vaccine in fully vaccinated people. In this clinical trial, fully vaccinated adults with no reported history of COVID-19 infection got a booster injection at least 12 weeks after the primary vaccination. They got one of the three vaccines: Moderna, Johnson & Johnson-Janssen, or Pfizer. On trial days 15 and 29 they were checked for booster safety, signs of the body’s response to the vaccine, and ability to build up protection against the COVID-19 virus. 458 people participated in the trial. 154 got Moderna, 150 got Johnson & Johnson, and 153 got Pfizer. Signs of the body’s response to the booster were similar to the primary vaccine. More than half had injection-site pain, general discomfort, headache, or muscle aches. All boosters increased the body's ability to protect itself against the SARS-CoV-2 virus from 4-fold to over 70-fold. The numbers of the antibodies that protect against COVID-19 increased from 5-fold to over 50-fold. Using the same vaccine for the boosters increased the protection up to 20-fold, but using a different vaccine increased the protection more. All boosters, except for Johnson & Johnson, increased the body's ability to protect itself agains the spike that the virus uses to get into the body cells. The Johnson & Johnson booster increased the number of cells that block the virus spike in people who were vaccinated with Moderna or Pfizer. All boosters were safe and increased protection against Covid-19 in adults who were fully vaccinated at least 12 weeks earlier.",2,C
59,35057798,"Background: The humoral immune response after primary immunisation with a SARS-CoV-2 vector vaccine (AstraZeneca AZD1222, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, Vaxzevria) followed by an mRNA vaccine boost (Pfizer/BioNTech, BNT162b2; Moderna, m-1273) was examined and compared with the antibody response after homologous vaccination schemes (AZD1222/AZD1222 or BNT162b2/BNT162b2). Methods: Sera from 59 vaccinees were tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) and virus-neutralising antibodies (VNA) with three IgG assays based on (parts of) the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S)-protein as antigen, an IgG immunoblot (additionally contains the SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein (NP) as an antigen), a surrogate neutralisation test (sVNT), and a Vero-cell-based virus-neutralisation test (cVNT) with the B.1.1.7 variant of concern (VOC; alpha) as antigen. Investigation was done before and after heterologous (n = 30 and 42) or homologous booster vaccination (AZD1222/AZD1222, n = 8/9; BNT162b2/BNT162b2, n = 8/8). After the second immunisation, a subgroup of 26 age- and gender-matched sera (AZD1222/mRNA, n = 9; AZD1222/AZD1222, n = 9; BNT162b2/BNT162b2, n = 8) was also tested for VNA against VOC B.1.617.2 (delta) in the cVNT. The strength of IgG binding to separate SARS-CoV-2 antigens was measured by avidity. Results: After the first vaccination, the prevalence of IgG directed against the (trimeric) SARS-CoV-2 S-protein and its receptor binding domain (RBD) varied from 55-95% (AZD1222) to 100% (BNT162b2), depending on the vaccine regimen and the SARS-CoV-2 antigen used. The booster vaccination resulted in 100% seroconversion and the occurrence of highly avid IgG, which is directed against the S-protein subunit 1 and the RBD, as well as VNA against VOC B.1.1.7, while anti-NP IgGs were not detected. The results of the three anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG tests showed an excellent correlation to the VNA titres against this VOC. The agreement of cVNT and sVNT results was good. However, the sVNT seems to overestimate non- and weak B.1.1.7-neutralising titres. The anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG concentrations and the B.1.1.7-neutralising titres were significantly higher after heterologous vaccination compared to the homologous AZD1222 scheme. If VOC B.1.617.2 was used as antigen, significantly lower VNA titres were measured in the cVNT, and three (33.3%) vector vaccine recipients had a VNA titre < 1:10. Conclusions: Heterologous SARS-CoV-2 vaccination leads to a strong antibody response with anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG concentrations and VNA titres at a level comparable to that of a homologous BNT162b2 vaccination scheme. Irrespective of the chosen immunisation regime, highly avid IgG antibodies can be detected just 2 weeks after the second vaccine dose indicating the development of a robust humoral immunity. The reduction in the VNA titre against VOC B.1.617.2 observed in the subgroup of 26 individuals is remarkable and confirms the immune escape of the delta variant.","We studied how the immune system responds to Pfizer or Moderna booster after AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccination. We compared these cross-vaccine boosters to using the same boosters as the original vaccine: AstraZeneca or Pfizer. We tested the blood of 59 vaccinated people for its ability to neutralize the SARS-CoV-2 virus and for the chemicals the body produced to fight the virus. The blood was tested before and after the booster vaccine was given.  After the first vaccine, chemicals against the parts of the virus that damage human cells ranged from 55-95% for AstraZeneca to 100% for Pfizer. After the boosters, the blood developed highly effective chemicals that block the parts of the virus that damage human cells.   Vaccination with different boosters caused the blood to produce more anti-COVID-19 chemicals that boosting with the same AstraZeneca vaccine. Boosting with different vaccines strongly protects against COVID-19 at about the same level as boosting with the same original Pfizer vaccine. All vaccines caused the blood to develop strong protection 2 weeks after the second vaccine dose. The protection against the delta variant of COVID-19 was not as strong in the 26 people in whom it was measured.",2,C
59,34918097,"Rationale for review: Heterologous prime-boost doses of COVID-19 vaccines ('mix-and-match' approach) are being studied to test for the effectiveness of Oxford (AZD1222), Pfizer (BNT162b2), Moderna (mRNA-1273) and Novavax (NVX-CoV2373) vaccines for COVID in 'Com-Cov2 trial' in UK, and that of Oxford and Pfizer vaccines in 'CombivacS trial' in Spain. Later, other heterologous combinatios of CoronaVac (DB15806), Janssen (JNJ-78436735), CanSino (AD5-nCOV), and other were also being trialed to explore their effectiveness. Previously, such a strategy was deployed for HIV, Ebola virus, malaria, tuberculosis, influenza, and hepatitis B to develop the artificial acquired active immunity. The present review explores the science behind such an approach for candidate COVID-19 vaccines developed using eleven different platforms approved by the World Health Organization. Key findings: The candidate vaccines' pharmaceutical parameters (e.g. platforms, number needed to vaccinate and intervals, adjuvanted status, excipients and preservatives added, efficacy and effectiveness, vaccine adverse events, and boosters), and clinical aspects must be analysed for the mix-and-match approach. Heterologous prime-boost trials showed safety, effectiveness, higher systemic reactogenicity, well tolerability with improved immunogenicity, and flexibility profiles for future vaccinations, especially during acute and global shortages, compared to the homologous counterparts. Conclusions/recommendations. Still, large controlled trials are warranted to address challenging variants of concerns including Omicron and other, and to generalize the effectiveness of the approach in regular as well as emergency use during vaccine scarcity.","‘Mix-and-match’ boosters against COVID-19 are being studied in UK and Spain using Oxford, Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax vaccines. Other combinations of CoronaVac, Janssen, and CanSino are also being tested. The ‘mix-and-match’ strategy has been used before to develop body protection against other diseases. We will try to understand why this approach might work for COVID-19. To study the mix-and-match approach, we look at how the different vaccines work, the chemicals in the vaccines and their side effects. The mix-and-match strategy is safe, improves body protection and allows to deal with vaccine shortages. ",2,C
59,34883053,"Background: Given the importance of flexible use of different COVID-19 vaccines within the same schedule to facilitate rapid deployment, we studied mixed priming schedules incorporating an adenoviral-vectored vaccine (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 [ChAd], AstraZeneca), two mRNA vaccines (BNT162b2 [BNT], Pfizer-BioNTech, and mRNA-1273 [m1273], Moderna) and a nanoparticle vaccine containing SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and Matrix-M adjuvant (NVX-CoV2373 [NVX], Novavax). Methods: Com-COV2 is a single-blind, randomised, non-inferiority trial in which adults aged 50 years and older, previously immunised with a single dose of ChAd or BNT in the community, were randomly assigned (in random blocks of three and six) within these cohorts in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive a second dose intramuscularly (8-12 weeks after the first dose) with the homologous vaccine, m1273, or NVX. The primary endpoint was the geometric mean ratio (GMR) of serum SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG concentrations measured by ELISA in heterologous versus homologous schedules at 28 days after the second dose, with a non-inferiority criterion of the GMR above 0·63 for the one-sided 98·75% CI. The primary analysis was on the per-protocol population, who were seronegative at baseline. Safety analyses were done for all participants who received a dose of study vaccine. The trial is registered with ISRCTN, number 27841311. Findings: Between April 19 and May 14, 2021, 1072 participants were enrolled at a median of 9·4 weeks after receipt of a single dose of ChAd (n=540, 47% female) or BNT (n=532, 40% female). In ChAd-primed participants, geometric mean concentration (GMC) 28 days after a boost of SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG in recipients of ChAd/m1273 (20 114 ELISA laboratory units [ELU]/mL [95% CI 18 160 to 22 279]) and ChAd/NVX (5597 ELU/mL [4756 to 6586]) was non-inferior to that of ChAd/ChAd recipients (1971 ELU/mL [1718 to 2262]) with a GMR of 10·2 (one-sided 98·75% CI 8·4 to ∞) for ChAd/m1273 and 2·8 (2·2 to ∞) for ChAd/NVX, compared with ChAd/ChAd. In BNT-primed participants, non-inferiority was shown for BNT/m1273 (GMC 22 978 ELU/mL [95% CI 20 597 to 25 636]) but not for BNT/NVX (8874 ELU/mL [7391 to 10 654]), compared with BNT/BNT (16 929 ELU/mL [15 025 to 19 075]) with a GMR of 1·3 (one-sided 98·75% CI 1·1 to ∞) for BNT/m1273 and 0·5 (0·4 to ∞) for BNT/NVX, compared with BNT/BNT; however, NVX still induced an 18-fold rise in GMC 28 days after vaccination. There were 15 serious adverse events, none considered related to immunisation. Interpretation: Heterologous second dosing with m1273, but not NVX, increased transient systemic reactogenicity compared with homologous schedules. Multiple vaccines are appropriate to complete primary immunisation following priming with BNT or ChAd, facilitating rapid vaccine deployment globally and supporting recognition of such schedules for vaccine certification.","It is important to have flexibility in using different COVID-19 vaccines for additional doses. We studied mixing AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax, which work differently. In this clinical trial, adults aged 50 years and older who received the first dose of AstraZeneca or Pfizer vaccine got a second dose of the same vaccine or Moderna or Novavax 8-12 weeks after the first dose. 28 days after the second dose, chemicals the body produces to protect itself against COVID-19 were measured in the blood. These people did not have these chemicals before the study. We also studied safety of the vaccines.  1072 people participated in the study 9.4 weeks after getting the first vaccine. 540 people got the first dose of AstraZeneca and 532 got Pfizer. There were somewhat more men than women in both groups. 28 days after the boosters, all people who had the first AstraZeneca vaccine had an increased number of chemicals against COVID-19 in their blood for all boosters. In people who had the Pfizer vaccine first, getting a Pfizer or Moderna booster increased the chemicals the most. Novavax also increased the amount of anti-COVID-19 chemicals, but not as much as the other boosters. 15 people had serious problems, but the problems were not caused by the vaccine. Getting a Moderna dose after AstraZeneca or Pfizer first vaccines temporarily increased protection against COVID-19 more than getting the same second vaccine. Novavax did not work the same way. Many vaccines can be used as the second dose after getting the first dose of AstraZeneca or Pfizer. This should help distributing vaccines around the world. ",2,C
59,34671773,"Background: While Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) vaccines are highly effective, breakthrough infections are occurring. Booster vaccinations have recently received emergency use authorization (EUA) for certain populations but are restricted to homologous mRNA vaccines. We evaluated homologous and heterologous booster vaccination in persons who had received an EUA Covid-19 vaccine regimen. Methods: In this phase 1/2 open-label clinical trial conducted at ten U.S. sites, adults who received one of three EUA Covid-19 vaccines at least 12 weeks prior to enrollment and had no reported history of SARS-CoV-2 infection received a booster injection with one of three vaccines (Moderna mRNA-1273 100-μg, Janssen Ad26.COV2.S 5×10 10 virus particles, or Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 30-μg; nine combinations). The primary outcomes were safety, reactogenicity, and humoral immunogenicity on study days 15 and 29. Results: 458 individuals were enrolled: 154 received mRNA-1273, 150 received Ad26.CoV2.S, and 153 received BNT162b2 booster vaccines. Reactogenicity was similar to that reported for the primary series. Injection site pain, malaise, headache, and myalgia occurred in more than half the participants. Booster vaccines increased the neutralizing activity against a D614G pseudovirus (4.2-76-fold) and binding antibody titers (4.6-56-fold) for all combinations; homologous boost increased neutralizing antibody titers 4.2-20-fold whereas heterologous boost increased titers 6.2-76-fold. Day 15 neutralizing and binding antibody titers varied by 28.7-fold and 20.9-fold, respectively, across the nine prime-boost combinations. Conclusion: Homologous and heterologous booster vaccinations were well-tolerated and immunogenic in adults who completed a primary Covid-19 vaccine regimen at least 12 weeks earlier.","Coronavirus disease 2019 vaccines protect against Covid-19 well, but some vaccinated people may get sick, which is called breakthrough infections. Boosters with the same Pfizer or Moderna vaccines are approved as an emergency measure for some people. We evaluated boosters with the same and different vaccines in people who got the emergency Covid-19 vaccination. In this clinical trial, adults in ten U.S. locations got Moderna, Janssen or Pfizer boosters at least 12 weeks after getting the first vaccine. We evaluated the vaccine safety and protection against COVID-19 on study days 15 and 29. Out of 458 people, 154 got Moderna, 150 got Janssen and 153 got Pfizer boosters. Adverse reactions to the booster were similar to those reported for the first vaccine. More than half of the participants had pain at the injection site, overall weakness, headache, and muscle pains. Boosters with the same and different vaccines increased protection against the virus. The increase in protection after a different booster was higher. Boosters with the same and different vaccines were well-tolerated and increased protection against COVID-19 in adults who had the first vaccine at least 12 weeks earlier.",2,C
59,34370971,"Background: Use of heterologous prime-boost COVID-19 vaccine schedules could facilitate mass COVID-19 immunisation. However, we have previously reported that heterologous schedules incorporating an adenoviral vectored vaccine (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, AstraZeneca; hereafter referred to as ChAd) and an mRNA vaccine (BNT162b2, Pfizer-BioNTech; hereafter referred to as BNT) at a 4-week interval are more reactogenic than homologous schedules. Here, we report the safety and immunogenicity of heterologous schedules with the ChAd and BNT vaccines. Methods: Com-COV is a participant-blinded, randomised, non-inferiority trial evaluating vaccine safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity. Adults aged 50 years and older with no or well controlled comorbidities and no previous SARS-CoV-2 infection by laboratory confirmation were eligible and were recruited at eight sites across the UK. The majority of eligible participants were enrolled into the general cohort (28-day or 84-day prime-boost intervals), who were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1) to receive ChAd/ChAd, ChAd/BNT, BNT/BNT, or BNT/ChAd, administered at either 28-day or 84-day prime-boost intervals. A small subset of eligible participants (n=100) were enrolled into an immunology cohort, who had additional blood tests to evaluate immune responses; these participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to the four schedules (28-day interval only). Participants were masked to the vaccine received but not to the prime-boost interval. The primary endpoint was the geometric mean ratio (GMR) of serum SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG concentration (measured by ELISA) at 28 days after boost, when comparing ChAd/BNT with ChAd/ChAd, and BNT/ChAd with BNT/BNT. The heterologous schedules were considered non-inferior to the approved homologous schedules if the lower limit of the one-sided 97·5% CI of the GMR of these comparisons was greater than 0·63. The primary analysis was done in the per-protocol population, who were seronegative at baseline. Safety analyses were done among participants receiving at least one dose of a study vaccine. The trial is registered with ISRCTN, 69254139. Findings: Between Feb 11 and Feb 26, 2021, 830 participants were enrolled and randomised, including 463 participants with a 28-day prime-boost interval, for whom results are reported here. The mean age of participants was 57·8 years (SD 4·7), with 212 (46%) female participants and 117 (25%) from ethnic minorities. At day 28 post boost, the geometric mean concentration of SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG in ChAd/BNT recipients (12 906 ELU/mL) was non-inferior to that in ChAd/ChAd recipients (1392 ELU/mL), with a GMR of 9·2 (one-sided 97·5% CI 7·5 to ∞). In participants primed with BNT, we did not show non-inferiority of the heterologous schedule (BNT/ChAd, 7133 ELU/mL) against the homologous schedule (BNT/BNT, 14 080 ELU/mL), with a GMR of 0·51 (one-sided 97·5% CI 0·43 to ∞). Four serious adverse events occurred across all groups, none of which were considered to be related to immunisation. Interpretation: Despite the BNT/ChAd regimen not meeting non-inferiority criteria, the SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG concentrations of both heterologous schedules were higher than that of a licensed vaccine schedule (ChAd/ChAd) with proven efficacy against COVID-19 disease and hospitalisation. Along with the higher immunogenicity of ChAd/BNT compared with ChAD/ChAd, these data support flexibility in the use of heterologous prime-boost vaccination using ChAd and BNT COVID-19 vaccines.","Boosters that are not of the same type as the first COVID-19 vaccine can make global COVID-19 immunization easier. However, we know that getting AstraZeneca and Pfizer 4 weeks apart causes more side effects than getting the same vaccine. We report the safety and protective strength of different ways to combine AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines. Healthy adults aged 50 years and older that did not have COVID-19 participated in a clinical trial. Most participants got two doses of AstraZeneca or Pfizer or a combination of Pfizer/AstraZeneca or AstraZeneca/Pfizer 28 or 84 days apart. 100 of the participants that had the vaccines 28 days apart was checked for the protective chemicals in the blood more often. Participants did not know which vaccines they got.  28 days after boost, chemicals that fight the SARS-CoV-2 virus were measured in patients' blood. Different-vaccine boosters were considered to be as good as the same-vaccine if the increase in the protective chemicals after the booster was the same or higher for the different vaccines. Protection against COVID-19 was measured in all participants. Safety of the vaccine was measured among participants that had at least one dose of the vaccine.  For 463 participants with 28 days between the first vaccine and the booster, the results are reported here. The participants were 54 to 65 years old. About half (212) were women and a quarter (117) were from ethnic minorities. 28 days after the booster, in people who got boosted with Pfizer after AstraZeneca, protection against the SARS-CoV-2 virus was not worse than in those who got the same AstraZeneca booster. Boosting with AstraZeneca after Pfizer was not as good as getting the second dose of the same Pfizer vaccine. Four people had serious health problems during the trial. The problems were not related to getting the vaccines. Although getting AstraZeneca after Pfizer was not as good as getting only Pfizer or Pfizer after AstraZeneca, there were still more protective chemicals against SARS-CoV-2 in the blood compared to getting only AstraZeneca. Getting only AstraZeneca is known to protect against COVID-19 and hospitalization. This trial supports using boosters that are not the same as the first COVID-19 vaccine.",2,C
59,35147657,"Reports of waning antibody levels and breakthrough infections among vaccinated individuals1 have prompted the recommendation for vaccine boosters to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections. Despite more than 80% of the population in Singapore having received 2 doses of a COVID-19 vaccine, cases surged in September 2021 with the relaxation of social distancing and quarantine measures. In response, adults 60 years and older who completed their primary vaccination series at least 6 months prior were invited to receive a booster injection and given a choice of either 30-μg BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) or 50-μg mRNA-1273 (Moderna). We estimated SARS-CoV-2 infections and disease severity with the receipt of a booster and by type of booster. Methods: This study was carried out under the Infectious Diseases Act for policy decision-making and exempted from ethical review and informed consent by the Singapore Ministry of Health. Rates and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infections between September 15 and October 31, 2021, among those eligible to receive vaccine boosters between September 15 and October 15, 2021, were analyzed based on official data reported to the Singapore Ministry of Health. Cases were identified through testing of symptomatic individuals and nonsymptomatic high-risk workers and close contacts. Outcomes included polymerase chain reaction–confirmed infections and severe disease (requiring oxygen supplementation, intensive care admission, or death due to COVID-19). Individuals were classified under the booster group 12 days after receiving a vaccine booster and under the nonbooster group otherwise to account for time required for antibody levels to rise. Person-days at risk were reported because individuals could contribute observations to both the nonbooster and booster groups. Using a Poisson regression, we estimated the incidence rate ratio (IRR) of confirmed infections and severe disease between booster and nonbooster groups by type of vaccine received for the primary series (BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273). Covariates included sex, race (4 official racial categories reported in Singapore are Chinese, Malay, Indian, and others and registered at birth according to the child’s parents’ race), housing type as a marker of socioeconomic status, age group, date of second vaccine dose to account for possible waning of immunity, and individual dummy variables for calendar date to adjust for the varying force of infection over the study period (eMethods in the Supplement). We obtained IRRs for individuals receiving the same vaccine as a booster (homologous boosted) and those receiving a different vaccine (heterologous boosted). Data analysis was carried out in Stata version 17.0 (StataCorp LLC) and a 2-sided P value less than .05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Among 703 209 eligible individuals during the study period, 576 132 received boosters. The study included 22 643 521 and 9 339 981 person-days among the nonbooster and booster groups, respectively. By person-days, 59% were 60 to 69 years, 29% were 70 to 79 years, and 11% were aged 80 years and older, with 53% being female. Among individuals who received BNT162b2 for their primary series, the incidences (per million person-days) of confirmed and severe infections were 227.9 and 1.4 for the homologous boosted compared with 600.4 and 20.5 for the nonboosted. The IRRs were 0.272 (95% CI, 0.258-0.286) for the confirmed cases among the homologous-boosted individuals and 0.047 (95% CI, 0.026-0.084) for severe cases (Table). For the heterologous-boosted individuals, the incidences of confirmed and severe infections were 147.9 and 2.3 cases per million person-days, respectively, with IRRs of 0.177 (95% CI, 0.138-0.227) and 0.078 (95% CI, 0.011-0.560). For individuals who received mRNA-1273 for their primary series, the incidence of confirmed infections for the homologous boosted was 133.9 cases per million person-years (IRR, 0.198 [95% CI, 0.144-0.271]). For heterologous-boosted individuals, the incidence of confirmed infections was 100.6 per million person-days (IRR, 0.140 [95% CI, 0.052-0.376]). The number of severe infections among individuals receiving mRNA-1273 for their primary series was too small to assess IRRs. Discussion: Heterologous boosting was associated with lower SARS-CoV-2 incidence rates than homologous boosting. Severe infections were lower among those receiving a booster after BNT162b2 as the primary series compared with the nonboosted individuals, regardless of the type of booster. Limitations of the study include potential confounding from unobservable individual characteristics that may influence individuals’ choice of booster, a short follow-up period, small numbers of infections after mRNA-1273 administration, and lack of data from younger age groups. The study results support recommendations for vaccine boosters and suggest that heterologous boosting may provide greater protection against COVID-19.","Boosters to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections in those who had the first vaccines are needed because the amount of body substances that protect against the virus goes down and people get COVID-19, which is called breakthrough infections. Although 80 out of 100 people in Singapore had 2 doses of a COVID-19 vaccine, COVID-19 surged in September 2021 as the social distancing and quarantine rules were relaxed. Adults 60 years and older who got the first vaccine at least 6 months before were invited to get a booster of Pfizer or Moderna. We estimated SARS-CoV-2 infections and disease severity after getting a booster and by type of booster. Rates and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infections between September 15 and October 31, 2021, among those eligible to receive vaccine boosters were studied. COVID-19 patients were found through testing of those with symptoms and high-risk workers and close contacts without symptoms. We measured infections confirmed by tests and severe disease (requiring oxygen support, intensive care admission, or death due to COVID-19). People who got the boosters 12 days before were included in the booster group, and non-booster group otherwise. Depending on the day of observation, a person could be in either group. We estimated getting infected and severe disease between booster and non-booster groups that got the first vaccination with Pfizer or Moderna. We accounted for the patients' sex, race, housing type, age, and the date of second vaccine that may be related to the strength of protection. We observed the rate of infection in those who got the same booster as the first vaccine and a different vaccine as booster.  Out of 703,209 people who were allowed to have a booster during the study, 576,132 got boosters. More than half of the people were 60 to 69 years old, a third 70 to 79 years, and a tenth of the people were 0 years and older. Slightly more than half of the people were women. Among those for whom the first vaccine and the booster was Pfizer, about 230 people got COVID-19 and about 2 had severe disease. Among those who had the first Pfizer vaccine but no booster, 600 got COVID-19 and 20 had severe disease. Among those who had a different booster, about 150 people got COVID-19 and about 2 had severe disease. Among those who had Moderna as their first vaccine and booster, about 134 got COVID-19. Among those who first had Moderna and then a Pfizer booster, about 100 had COVID-19. The number of severe infections among those who had Moderna as the first vaccine was too small to count. People who got different boosters had less COVID-19 infections than those boosted with the same vaccine as the first. People who first had Pfizer and then any booster had less severe disease than those who did not have boosters. This study has limitations, such as not knowing why people decided for or against boosters, short time between the booster and the study, and no data from younger age groups. The study supports having vaccine boosters. Boosting with different vaccines may provide greater protection against COVID-19.",2,C
59,35126395,"Background: Heterologous vaccinations against SARS-CoV-2 with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and a second dose of an mRNA-based vaccine have been shown to be more immunogenic than homologous ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. In the current study, we examined the kinetics of the antibody response to the second dose of three different vaccination regimens (homologous ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vs. ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 + BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273) against SARS-CoV-2 in a longitudinal manner; whether there are differences in latency or amplitude of the early response and which markers are most suitable to detect these responses. Methods: We performed assays for anti-S1 IgG and IgA, anti-NCP IgG and a surrogate neutralization assay on serum samples collected from 57 participants on the day of the second vaccination as well as the following seven days. Results: All examined vaccination regimens induced detectable antibody responses within the examined time frame. Both heterologous regimens induced responses earlier and with a higher amplitude than homologous ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. Between the heterologous regimens, amplitudes were somewhat higher for ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 + mRNA-1273. There was no difference in latency between the IgG and IgA responses. Increases in the surrogate neutralization assay were the first changes to be detectable for all regimens and the only significant change seen for homologous ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. Discussion: Both examined heterologous vaccination regimens are superior in immunogenicity, including the latency of the response, to homologous ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. While the IgA response has a shorter latency than the IgG response after the first dose, no such difference was found after the second dose, implying that both responses are driven by separate plasma cell populations. Early and steep increases in surrogate neutralization levels suggest that this might be a more sensitive marker for antibody responses after vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 than absolute levels of anti-S1 IgG.",Getting a Pfizer or Moderna booster after the AstraZeneca vaccine protects against COVID-19 better than getting the same AstraZeneca booster. We studied how a booster with the same AstraZeneca or a different Pfizer or Moderna vaccine protects against COVID-19 over time. We analyzed chemicals that protect against COVID-19 in the blood of 57 people on the day of the second vaccination and the following seven days. All boosters increased the protective chemicals in the blood. Different boosters had earlier and stronger protection than boosting with the same AstraZeneca vaccine. People who had Moderna booster after the first AstraZeneca vaccine had more protective chemicals than those who got Pfizer. The body produced different protective chemicals at the same time.  The different boosters were more protective than the same AstraZeneca booster.  ,2,C
59,35099023,"Introduction: The vital renal replacement therapy makes it impossible for dialysis patients to distance themselves socially. This results in a high risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and developing COVID-19 with excess mortality due to disease burden and immunosuppression. We determined the efficacy of a 100 µg booster of mRNA-1273 (Moderna, Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA) 6 months after two doses of BNT162b2 (BioNTech/Pfizer, Mainz, Germany/New York, NY, USA) in 194 SARS-CoV-2 naïve dialysis patients. Methods: Anti-SARS-CoV-2-spike antibodies were measured with the Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S assay (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Germany) 4 and 10-12 weeks after two doses of BNT162b2 as well as 4 weeks after the mRNA-1273 booster. The presence of neutralizing antibodies was measured by the SARS-CoV-2 Surrogate Virus Neutralization Test (GenScript Biotech, USA). Two different cut-offs for positivity were used, one according to the manufacturer's specifications and one correlating with positivity in a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). ROC analyses were performed to match the anti-SARS-CoV-2-spike antibody cut-offs with the cut-offs in the surrogate neutralization assay accordingly. Results: Any level of immunoreactivity determined by anti-SARS-CoV-2-spike antibody assay was found in 87.3% (n = 144/165) and 90.6% (n = 164/181) 4 and 10-12 weeks after two doses of BNT162b2. This was reduced to 68.5% or 60.6% 4 weeks and 51.7% or 35.4% 10-12 weeks, respectively, when using the ROC revealed cut-offs for neutralizing antibodies in the surrogate neutralization test (manufacturer given cut-off ≥ 103 U/ml and cut-off correlating with PRNT ≥ 196 U/ml). Four weeks after the mRNA-1273 booster, the concentration of anti-SARS-CoV-2-spike antibodies increased to 23 119.9 U/ml and consecutively to 97.3% for both cut-offs of neutralizing antibodies. Conclusion: Two doses of BNT162b2 followed by one dose of mRNA-1273 within 6 months in patients receiving maintenance dialysis resulted in significant titers of SARS-CoV-2-S-Ab. While two doses of mRNA vaccine only achieved adequate humoral immunity in a minority, the third vaccination boosts the development of virus-neutralizing quantities of SARS-CoV-2 spike antibodies (against wild type SARS-CoV-2) in almost all patients.","Dialysis patients cannot distance themselves socially. They are at high risk of developing COVID-19 with high mortality. We studied Moderna boosters 6 months after two doses of Pfizer in 194 dialysis patients who did not have SARS-CoV-2 infection. We measured the chemicals that protect against the COVID-19 virus 4 weeks after Pfizer and Moderna boosters, and also 10-12 weeks after Pfizer  Protective chemicals were found in about 9 out of 10 people 4 and 10-12 weeks after two doses of Pfizer. Looking at different protective thresholds, protection was reduced to 7 out of 10 after 4 weeks and around half after 10-12 weeks. For Moderna, almost all people had strong protection after 4 weeks. People on dialysis who were vaccinated with Pfizer and got Moderna booster within the next 6 month had significant protection against the COVID-19 virus. While the first two doses of Moderna or Pfizer vaccine gave adequate protection to some patients, the booster increased protection against the COVID-19 virus in almost all patients.",2,C
59,35131144,"In Spain, 1.5 million essential < 60-year-old workers were vaccinated with a first AstraZeneca vaccine dose. After assessing the cases of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia associated to this vaccine, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) supported the administration of 2 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine with no age restrictions. Nevertheless, Spain decided not to administer the second dose of this vaccine to < 60-year-olds. The government sponsored a clinical trial (CombiVacS) to assess the immunogenicity response to a Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine dose in adults primed with the AstraZeneca vaccine. The positive results backed the Public Health Commission and the Spanish Ministry of Health to offer the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine as the booster. Nevertheless, regional public health authorities-responsible for administering vaccines-believed that, following the EMA's decision, an AstraZeneca booster dose should be given. The public confrontation of these 2 positions forced the Spanish Health Ministry to request the signature of an informed consent form to those individuals willing to receive the AstraZeneca vaccine booster and rejecting the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine dose. Eventually, it was decided that these essential workers could choose the vaccine but signing an informed consent form. All relevant information was posted on the Ministry of Health and regional health authorities' websites and provided to potential vaccine recipients at vaccination sites. Most individuals (≥ 75%) chose the AstraZeneca vaccine: perhaps because they likely trusted the EMA more than the CombiVacS results. This unprecedented and massive exercise of individual autonomy about the choice of COVID-19 vaccines from 2 different platforms has shown that adequately informed persons can autonomously weigh their options, regardless of government decisions. Exercising individual autonomy may contribute to the success of future COVID-19 booster vaccination campaigns.","In Spain, 1.5 million essential workers under 60 years of age got a first AstraZeneca vaccine dose. Although this vaccine was associated with blood clots and reduction in blood cells, the European Medicines Agency recommended two doses of AstraZeneca for all ages. Spain decided not to give the second dose of this vaccine to people under 60 years old. The government sponsored a clinical trial to evaluate if a dose of Pfizer vaccine works in adults who first got the AstraZeneca vaccine. The positive results supported giving the Pfizer vaccine as the booster. Some local authorities decided to follow the recommendation that an AstraZeneca booster should be given. Because of these contradictions, the Spanish Health Ministry requested those who decide to get the AstraZeneca booster and decline Pfizer should sign an informed consent form. Later these essential workers could choose the vaccine but still sign an informed consent form. Relevant information was posted on the web and given to people at vaccination sites. Three quarters of people getting the vaccine chose AstraZeneca; maybe because they trusted the European Medicines Agency more.  Giving people a choice may make future COVID-19 boosters more successful.",2,C
60,32766111,"We experienced a 72-year-old man who developed laboratory-confirmed human coronavirus HKU1 pneumonia. PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 from a nasopharyngeal specimen was negative twice, and rapid immunochromatographic antibody test (RIAT) using a commercially available kit for IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2 showed him turning positive for IgG against SARS-CoV-2. We then performed RIAT in stored serum samples from other patients who suffered laboratory-confirmed human common cold coronaviruses (n = 6) and viruses other than coronavirus (influenza virus, n = 3; rhinovirus, n = 3; metapneumovirus, n = 1; adenovirus, n = 1) admitted until January 2019. Including the present case, four of 7 (57%) showed false-positive RIAT results due to human common cold coronaviruses infection. Two of the 4 patients showed initial negative to subsequent positive RIAT results, indicating seroconversion. RIAT was positive for IgG and IgM in viruses other than coronavirus in 2 (25.0%) and 1 (12.5%) patient. Because of high incidence of false positive RIAT results, cross antigenicity between human common cold coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 can be considered. Results of RIAT should be interpreted in light of epidemics of human common cold coronaviruses infection. Prevalence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection may be overestimated due to high incidence of false-positive RIAT results.","A 72-year-old man has a confirmed human coronavirus HKU1 pneumonia. His nasal swab test for COVID-19 virus was negative twice, but his antibody (chemicals the body produces to fight the virus) test was positive. We then did the antibody test on the stored blood of other patients who had confirmed viral infections, such as flu and common cold, before January 2019. Including the present case, four of 7 antibody test results were falsely positive for COVID-19.  The high rate of the falsely positive antibody test results might be due to similarities between the human common cold coronaviruses and the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19. The results of the antibody tests may depend on epidemics of human common cold coronavirus infection. The spread of the past SARS-CoV-2 infections may be overestimated because of the falsely positive antibody test results.",2,C
60,33272198,"Background: Combating the COVID-19 pandemic is a major challenge for health systems, citizens and policy makers worldwide. Early detection of affected patients within the large and heterogeneous group of patients with common cold symptoms is an important element of this effort, but often hindered by limited testing resources, false-negative test results and the lack of pathognomonic symptoms in COVID-19. Therefore, we aimed to identify anamnestic items with an increased/decreased odds ratio for a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR (CovPCR) result in a primary care setting. Methods: We performed a multi-center cross-sectional cohort study on predictive clinical characteristics for a positive CovPCR over a period of 4 weeks in primary care patients in Germany. Results: In total, 374 patients in 14 primary care centers received CovPCR and were included in this analysis. The median age was 44.0 (IQR: 31.0-59.0) and a fraction of 10.7% (n = 40) tested positive for COVID-19. Patients who reported anosmia had a higher odds ratio (OR: 4.54; 95%-CI: 1.51-13.67) for a positive test result while patients with a sore throat had a lower OR (OR: 0.33; 95%-CI: 0.11-0.97). Furthermore, patients who had a first grade contact with an infected persons and showed symptoms themselves also had an increased OR for positive testing (OR: 5.16; 95% CI: 1.72-15.51). This correlation was also present when they themselves were still asymptomatic (OR: 12.55; 95% CI: 3.97-39.67). Conclusions: Several anamnestic criteria may be helpful to assess pre-test probability of COVID-19 in patients with common cold symptoms."," It is hard to detect COVID-19 patients in a group of patients with common cold symptoms because there are no COVID-specific symptoms, there are not enough test supplies, and test results can be falsely negative in patients with COVID-19. We aim to find some strong signs in the COVID test results that show SARS-CoV-2 infection. We studied 374 patients who got rapid COVID tests. Patients were 31 to 59 years old, and one tenth of them had positive COVID-19 test results. Patients who lost their sense pf smell had a higher chance to test positive for COVID-19. Patients with a sore throat had a lower chance to test positive for COVID-19. Patients who had contact with an infected persons and had symptoms themselves also had an increased chance to test positive. Even if they did not have symptoms, these patients had higher chances to test positive. ",2,C
60,33773413,"Antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDTs) can complement molecular diagnostics for COVID-19. The recommended temperature for storage of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs ranges between 2-30 °C. In the global South, mean temperatures can exceed 30 °C. In the global North, Ag-RDTs are often used in external testing facilities at low ambient temperatures. We assessed analytical sensitivity and specificity of eleven commercially-available SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs using different storage and operational temperatures, including short- or long-term storage and operation at recommended temperatures or at either 2-4 °C or at 37 °C. The limits of detection of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs under recommended conditions ranged from 1.0×106- 5.5×107 genome copies/mL of infectious SARS-CoV-2 cell culture supernatant. Despite long-term storage at recommended conditions, 10 min pre-incubation of Ag-RDTs and testing at 37 °C resulted in about ten-fold reduced sensitivity for five out of 11 SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs, including both Ag-RDTs currently listed for emergency use by the World Health Organization. After 3 weeks of storage at 37 °C, eight of the 11 SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs exhibited about ten-fold reduced sensitivity. Specificity of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs using cell culture supernatant from common respiratory viruses was not affected by storage and testing at 37 °C, whereas false-positive results occurred at outside temperatures of 2-4 °C for two out of six tested Ag-RDTs, again including an Ag-RDT recommended by the WHO. In summary, elevated temperatures impair sensitivity, whereas low temperatures impair specificity of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs. Consequences may include false-negative test results at clinically relevant virus concentrations compatible with transmission and false-positive results entailing unwarranted quarantine assignments. Storage and operation of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs at recommended conditions is essential for successful usage during the pandemic.","Rapid diagnostic tests can support other COVID-q9 tests. Rapid covid tests could be refrigerated or stored at room temperature under 30 degrees C (86 Fahrenheit)  We tested the accuracy of eleven rapid COVID tests that were stored and used at different temperatures. The tests were stored for a short or long time at recommended temperatures or at either 2-4 degrees C (35-39 Fahrenheit) or at 37 degrees C (98-99 Fahrenheit). The tests were stored for a long-term at recommended temperatures and then at the high temperature (37C) for 10 minutes. For five out of 11 rapid tests, the accuracy was reduced ten-fold. After 3 weeks of storage at high temperature (37 C), eight of the 11 rapid tests were ten-fold less accurate. Two out of six rapid tests had false positive results at low temperatures (2-4 degrees C). In summary, high temperatures reduced how well the test identified people who had COVID-19 and low temperatures caused false positive results, showing people who did not have COVID-19 as having it. The false negative test results allow people who have the virus transmit it to others. Due to the false-positive results healthy people will be quarantined. Storing the rapid tests at recommended temperatures is important during the pandemic.",2,C
60,35051204,"Background: COVID-19 is an ongoing public health pandemic regardless of the countless efforts made by various actors. Quality diagnostic tests are important for early detection and control. Notably, several commercially available one step RT-PCR based assays have been recommended by the WHO. Yet, their analytic and diagnostic performances have not been well documented in resource-limited settings. Hence, this study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic sensitivities and specificities of three commercially available one step reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays in Ethiopia in clinical setting. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted from April to June, 2021 on 279 respiratory swabs originating from community surveillance, contact cases and suspect cases. RNA was extracted using manual extraction method. Master-mix preparation, amplification and result interpretation was done as per the respective manufacturer. Agreements between RT-PCRs were analyzed using kappa values. Bayesian latent class models (BLCM) were fitted to obtain reliable estimates of diagnostic sensitivities, specificities of the three assays and prevalence in the absence of a true gold standard. Results: Among the 279 respiratory samples, 50(18%), 59(21.2%), and 69(24.7%) were tested positive by TIB, Da An, and BGI assays, respectively. Moderate to substantial level of agreement was reported among the three assays with kappa value between 0 .55 and 0.72. Based on the BLCM relatively high specificities (95% CI) of 0.991(0.973-1.000), 0.961(0.930-0.991) and 0.916(0.875-0.952) and considerably lower sensitivities with 0.813(0.658-0.938), 0.836(0.712-0.940) and 0.810(0.687-0.920) for TIB MOLBIOL, Da An and BGI respectively were found. Conclusions: While all the three RT-PCR assays displayed comparable sensitivities, the specificities of TIB MOLBIOL and Da An were considerably higher than BGI. These results help adjust the apparent prevalence determined by the three RT-PCRs and thus support public health decisions in resource limited settings and consider alternatives as per their prioritization matrix.","COVID-19 is an ongoing public health pandemic. Quality diagnostic tests are important for early detection and control. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends some tests that detect COVID-19 virus. But we do not know how accurate these tests are.

Among the 279 respiratory samples, 50, 59, and 69 tested positive by the three tests. The tests agreed ranging from moderate to strong agreement. The tests accurately recognized people that did not have COVID (91 to 99 out of 100), but had more mistakes identifying people who had COVID, only 81 to 83 out of 100 sick people were found. All three tests were almost equal in identifying people with COVID-19, but one test was worse than the other two in identifying people without the disease. ",2,C
60,34967441,"To investigate endogenous interference factors of the detection results of novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) IgM/IgG. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG in sera of 200 patients without COVID-19 infection, including rheumatoid factor (RF) positive group, antinuclear antibody (ANA) positive group, pregnant women group, and normal senior group, with 50 in each group and 100 normal controls. The level of SARS-CoV-2 IgG in pregnant women was significantly higher than that in the normal control group (p = 0.000), but there was no significant difference between other groups. The levels of SARS-CoV-2 IgM in the pregnant women group, normal senior group, ANA positive group, and RF positive group were significantly higher than that in the normal control group (p < 0.05), with significant higher false-positive rates in these groups (p = 0.036, p = 0.004, p = 0.000, vs. normal control group). Serum RF caused SARS-CoV-2 IgM false-positive in a concentration-dependent manner, especially when its concentration was higher than 110.25 IU/L, and the urea dissociation test can turn the false positive to negative. ANA, normal seniors, pregnant women, and RF can lead to false-positive reactivity of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and/or IgG detected using ELISA. These factors should be considered when SARS-CoV-2 IgM or IgG detection is positive, false positive samples caused by RF positive can be used for urea dissociation test.","Our aim is to find what could cause wrong COVID-19 test results. Blood of 200 patients without COVID-19 infection was tested for proteins that protect against COVID-19 virus. 100 of the patients were healthy, the others had proteins that could attack their own bodies or proteins associated with pregnancy, 50 each. Pregnant women had more of the common anti-COVID protein, but all other groups had the same amounts. There was more anti-COVID protein the body makes when it fights a new infection in pregnant women, normal seniors, and people with proteins that attack their own body. These groups had significantly more false positive COVID test results. Some of the false positive tests caused by the protein that attack your own body can be turned into true negative by adding a chemical called urea to the test. False positive test results could be caused by pregnancy, old age and proteins that attack your own body. ",2,C
60,34910739,"At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) designed, manufactured, and distributed the CDC 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel for SARS-CoV-2 detection. The diagnostic panel targeted three viral nucleocapsid gene loci (N1, N2, and N3 primers and probes) to maximize sensitivity and to provide redundancy for virus detection if mutations occurred. After the first distribution of the diagnostic panel, state public health laboratories reported fluorescent signal in the absence of viral template (false-positive reactivity) for the N3 component and to a lesser extent for N1. This report describes the findings of an internal investigation conducted by the CDC to identify the cause(s) of the N1 and N3 false-positive reactivity. For N1, results demonstrate that contamination with a synthetic template, that occurred while the ""bulk"" manufactured materials were located in a research lab for quality assessment, was the cause of false reactivity in the first lot. Base pairing between the 3' end of the N3 probe and the 3' end of the N3 reverse primer led to amplification of duplex and larger molecules resulting in false reactivity in the N3 assay component. We conclude that flaws in both assay design and handling of the ""bulk"" material, caused the problems with the first lot of the 2019-nCoV Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel. In addition, within this study, we found that the age of the examined diagnostic panel reagents increases the frequency of false positive results for N3. We discuss these findings in the context of improvements to quality control, quality assurance, and assay validation practices that have since been improved at the CDC.","At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) designed, provides rapid test for detecting SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes the disease.

We report the results of the CDC analysis of the false positive tests.. One part of the test that targeted one part of the virus was tainted with the material similar to that part when the test was produced, which caused false positive results. In another component of the test, some chemicals interacted with each other and caused false positive results. We conclude that the first batch of CDC rapid tests had problems with the design of the test and manufacturing. We found that the tests that were stored longer gave more false positive results.

Individuals, aged 18 years or older, who self-booked an appointment for real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test in March 2021 at a public test center in Copenhagen, Denmark were included. An oropharyngeal swab was collected for RT-PCR testing, followed by a swab from the anterior parts of the nose examined by Ag test (SD Biosensor). Accuracy of the Ag test was calculated with RT-PCR as reference. We included 7074 paired conclusive tests (n = 3461, female: 50.7%). The median age was 48 years (IQR: 36-57 years).

60,34668722,"Antigen-based rapid diagnostics tests (Ag-RDTs) are useful tools for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) detection. However, misleading demonstrations of the Abbott Panbio coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) Ag-RDT on social media claimed that SARS-CoV-2 antigen could be detected in municipal water and food products. To offer a scientific rebuttal to pandemic misinformation and disinformation, this study explored the impact of using the Panbio SARS-CoV-2 assay with conditions falling outside manufacturer recommendations. Using Panbio, various water and food products, laboratory buffers, and SARS-CoV-2-negative clinical specimens were tested with and without manufacturer buffer. Additional experiments were conducted to assess the role of each Panbio buffer component (tricine, NaCl, pH, and Tween 20) as well as the impact of temperature (4°C, 20°C, and 45°C) and humidity (90%) on assay performance. Direct sample testing (without the kit buffer) resulted in false-positive signals resembling those obtained with SARS-CoV-2 positive controls tested under proper conditions. The likely explanation of these artifacts is nonspecific interactions between the SARS-CoV-2-specific conjugated and capture antibodies, as proteinase K treatment abrogated this phenomenon, and thermal shift assays showed pH-induced conformational changes under conditions promoting artifact formation. Omitting, altering, and reverse engineering the kit buffer all supported the importance of maintaining buffering capacity, ionic strength, and pH for accurate kit function. Interestingly, the Panbio assay could tolerate some extremes of temperature and humidity outside manufacturer claims. Our data support strict adherence to manufacturer instructions to avoid false-positive SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDT reactions, otherwise resulting in anxiety, overuse of public health resources, and dissemination of misinformation. IMPORTANCE: With the Panbio severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antigen test being deployed in over 120 countries worldwide, understanding conditions required for its ideal performance is critical. Recently on social media, this kit was shown to generate false positives when manufacturer recommendations were not followed. While erroneous results from improper use of a test may not be surprising to some health care professionals, understanding why false positives occur can help reduce the propagation of misinformation and provide a scientific rebuttal for these aberrant findings. This study demonstrated that the kit buffer's pH, ionic strength, and buffering capacity were critical components to ensure proper kit function and avoid generation of false-positive results. Typically, false positives arise from cross-reacting or interfering substances; however, this study demonstrated a mechanism where false positives were generated under conditions favoring nonspecific interactions between the two antibodies designed for SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection. Following the manufacturer instructions is critical for accurate test results.","Rapid diagnostics tests are useful for detecting COVID-19 virus. Misleading demos of the rapid test on social media showed it can find COVID-19 virus in the tap water and food. To fight misleading information, we studied the results of the rapid tests that did not follow testing rules. We did the test in a wrong way on water, food, other liquids and samples without the COVID-19 virus. We also studied how different temperatures and humidity change test results. Doing the test wrong caused false positive results saying there is COVID-19 virus in the materials that did not have it. False results may happen because the parts of the test change if the test is done wrong.  The test changed less in extremes of temperature and humidity. Our study supports strictly following the test instructions to reduce false positive results of COVID-19 rapid test. False positive results increase anxiety, overuse of public health resources, and spread of rumors. The Panbio rapid COVID-19 test that we studied is used in over 120 countries worldwide. It is very important to understand how to get accurate test results. Recently on social media, this kit was shown to generate false positives when manufacturer recommendations were not followed. Health professionals know that not doing the tests right causes errors in the results. Knowing what causes the errors will help them explain the errors and stop rumors. Many different parts of the test need to work properly to avoid mistakes. In many cases, test errors are caused by the chemicals our bodies have to fight other infections or some other chemicals that accidentally got into the test. Our study shows how the parts of the test can cause errors if the test is not done right. Following the manufacturer instructions is critical for accurate test results.",2,C
60,34558034,"Positive retests of COVID-19 represent a public health concern because of the increased risk of transmission. This study explored whether factors other than the nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) contribute to positive retest results. Patients with COVID-19 admitted to the Guanggu district of the Hubei Maternal and Child Health Hospital between February 17 and March 28, 2020, were retrospectively included. The patients were grouped into the negative (n = 133) and positive (n = 51) retest groups. The results showed that the proportion of patients presenting with cough was higher (P < 0.001) and the proportion of patients with dyspnea was lower (P = 0.018) in the positive than in the negative retest group. The positive retest group showed shorter durations between symptom onset and hospitalization (P < 0.001) and symptom onset and the first positive NAAT (P = 0.033). The positive retest group had higher basophil counts (P = 0.023) and direct bilirubin (P = 0.032) and chlorine concentrations (P = 0.023) but lower potassium concentrations (P = 0.001) than the negative retest group. Multivariable regression analysis showed that coughing (OR = 7.59, 95% CI 2.28-25.32, P = 0.001) and serum chloride concentrations (OR = 1.38, 95% CI 1.08-1.77, P = 0.010) were independently associated with a positive retest result. Coughing and serum chloride concentrations were independent risk factors for positive NAAT retest results. Patients with a hospital stay of < 2 weeks or a short incubation period should stay in isolation and be monitored to reduce transmission. These results could help identify patients who require closer surveillance.","Repeated positive COVID-19 tests show that the risk of new people getting the disease is growing. We studied what causes positive test results. We studied children with COVID-19 who were at the hospital in February - March 2020. 133 children had negative rpeated COVID-19 test results and 51 had positive results. Among patients with repeated positive tests, there were more with cough and fewer with shortness of breath, compared to patients with the negative test. Patients who had symptoms and repeated positive tests were admitted to the hospital and had positive test results earlier. People who had repeated positive tests also had different blood test results compared to the people with negative tests. Coughing and a certain blood test result were each associated with a positive retest result. Patients who stayed at the hospital for less than 2 weeks or had symptoms shortly after getting COVID-19 should be quarantined. These results could help identify patients who require closer surveillance.",2,C
60,33983916,"Prompt and accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, has been important during public health responses for containing the spread of COVID-19, including in hospital settings (1-3). In vitro diagnostic nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT), such as real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) can be expensive, have relatively long turnaround times, and require experienced laboratory personnel.* Antigen detection tests can be rapidly and more easily performed and are less expensive. The performance† of antigen detection tests, compared with that of NAATs, is an area of interest for the rapid diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The Quidel Sofia 2 SARS Antigen Fluorescent Immunoassay (FIA) (Quidel Corporation) received Food and Drug Administration Emergency Use Authorization for use in symptomatic patients within 5 days of symptom onset (4). The reported test positive percentage agreement§ between this test and an RT-PCR test result is 96.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 83.3%-99.4%), and the negative percentage agreement is 100.0% (95% CI = 97.9%-100.0%) in symptomatic patients.¶ However, performance in asymptomatic persons in a university setting has shown lower sensitivity (5); assessment of performance in a clinical setting is ongoing. Data collected during June 30-August 31, 2020, were analyzed to compare antigen test performance with that of RT-PCR in a hospital setting. Among 1,732 paired samples from asymptomatic patients, the antigen test sensitivity was 60.5%, and specificity was 99.5% when compared with RT-PCR. Among 307 symptomatic persons, sensitivity and specificity were 72.1% and 98.7%, respectively. Health care providers must remain aware of the lower sensitivity of this test among asymptomatic and symptomatic persons and consider confirmatory NAAT testing in high-prevalence settings because a false-negative result might lead to failures in infection control and prevention practices and cause delays in diagnosis, isolation, and treatment.","Fast and accurate COVID-19 tests help reduce the spread of the disease, including in hospitals. Some of the known tests are expensive, take a long time and need training to do the test. Other tests are fast and easy to do without training. Accuracy of the easier and faster tests compared to the traditional tests is an area of interest. The Quidel rapid test was approved for emergency use in patients within the first 5 days of COVID-19 symptoms. These tests agreed with the traditional test for 83 to 99 out of 100 patients with positive results and 97 to all 100 patients with negative results. For the COVID-19 patients that did not have symptoms, the tests were not as accurate as the traditional test. We compared test results at a hospital in June - August 2020. Among 1,732 patients that had no symptoms the rapid test agreed with the traditional test on about 60 out of 100 positive tests, and on almost all negative tests. Among 307 patients that had symptoms the rapid test agreed with the traditional test on over 70 out of 100 positive tests, and on almost all negative tests. As rapid test misses many COVID-19 cases, traditional tests might be needed when the disease is on the rise. False negative test results cause delays in quarantine and treatment of COVID-19.",2,C
62,234488,"A double-blind crossover study of inhibition of histamine-induced pruritus by three commonly prescribed antihistamines was conducted on 28 normal subjects. Drugs used included diphenhydramine HCl (Benadryl), cyproheptadine (Periactin), hydroxyzine HCl (Atarax), and a lactose placebo in identical capsules. Intradermal histamine dose-response thresholds of pruritus were obtained before and after pretreatment with the three antihistamines and placebo in each subject. Analysis of data revealed a fivefold increase above baseline of the histamine dose required to produce pruritus following both cyproheptadine and placebo. This compared to a tenfold increase following diphenhydramine and a 750-fold increase following hydroxyzine HCl. The most common side effect was drowsiness, which occurred with all three drugs.","Three commonly prescribed drugs (antihistamines) for itching caused by histamine, a chemical the body releases during allergic reactions, were studied on 28 healthy people. The drugs in identical capsules included Benadryl, Periactin, Atarax, and a placebo (a pill that contains no drug). The thresholds of itching due to histamine were measured before and after taking the drugs. For Periactin and placebo, the dose of histamine that caused itching increased fivefold. For Benadryl, the dose had to be 10 times higher, and for Atarax 750 times higher. The most common side effect was drowsiness, which occurred with all three drugs.",2,C
62,33141610,"Background: This study aimed to measure the association of various H1-antihistamines (H1A) with Torsade de Pointes (TdP), and present a comprehensive overview of H1A-induced TdP cases reported to the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). Methods: All H1A-induced TdP cases (n = 406) were retrieved from the FAERS database using the preferred term 'Torsade de Pointes' of MedDRA version-22 from 1990 to 2019. Four data-mining algorithms were used for disproportionality analysis: Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR); Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR), Empirical Bayes Geometric Mean (EBGM), and Information Content (IC). H1A with >3 TdP cases were included. Results: A total of 12 signals (Astemizole, cetirizine, chlorpheniramine, clemastine, desloratadine, diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine, loratadine, meclizine, promethazine, terfenadine, and trimeprazine) were identified including six new signals (cetirizine, chlorpheniramine, clemastine, desloratadine, loratadine, and meclizine). The number of risk factors (p = 0.031) and concomitant QT-prolonging drugs (p = <0.001) were significantly lower among new signals vs old signals. Moreover, new signals were strongly associated with QT-prolongation, cardiac reactions, and electrolyte abnormalities as compared with old signals. Conclusions: Our study found the increased torsadogenic potential of new signals compared with previously known old signals, hence necessitating clinical studies to determine the actual torsadogenic potential of newly identified signals.",We studied relations between antihistamines (drugs for treating allergies) and Torsade de Pointes (very fast heart rhythm) as reported to the FDA. We found 406 reports on Torsade de Pointes and antihistamines. We used four different statistical methods to study the cases. Antihistamines that had more than three reports of torsade de pointes were included in the analysis. We found 12 drugs associated with torsade de pointes. Six of the drugs were not known before to cause torsade de pointes. Getting antihistamines with other drugs that cause heart complications was lower than for the known antihistamines. The new antihistamines were associated with heart complications stronger than the known ones. The new antihistamines were associated with torsade de pointes stronger. ,2,C
62,28480041,"Several noncardiac drugs have been linked to cardiac safety concerns, highlighting the importance of post-marketing surveillance and continued evaluation of the benefit-risk of long-established drugs. Here, we examine the risk of QT prolongation and/or torsade de pointes (TdP) associated with the use of hydroxyzine, a first generation sedating antihistamine. We have used a combined methodological approach to re-evaluate the cardiac safety profile of hydroxyzine, including: (1) a full review of the sponsor pharmacovigilance safety database to examine real-world data on the risk of QT prolongation and/or TdP associated with hydroxyzine use and (2) nonclinical electrophysiological studies to examine concentration-dependent effects of hydroxyzine on a range of human cardiac ion channels. Based on a review of pharmacovigilance data between 14th December 1955 and 1st August 2016, we identified 59 reports of QT prolongation and/or TdP potentially linked to hydroxyzine use. Aside from intentional overdose, all cases involved underlying medical conditions or concomitant medications that constituted at least 1 additional risk factor for such events. The combination of cardiovascular disorders plus concomitant treatment of drugs known to induce arrhythmia was identified as the greatest combined risk factor. Parallel patch-clamp studies demonstrated hydroxyzine concentration-dependent inhibition of several human cardiac ion channels, including the ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) potassium ion channels. Results from this analysis support the listing of hydroxyzine as a drug with ""conditional risk of TdP"" and are in line with recommendations to limit hydroxyzine use in patients with known underlying risk factors for QT prolongation and/or TdP.","Several drugs can cause heart problems. It is important to monitor and evaluate risks of traditional drugs. We study if taking hydroxyzine, a drug that relieves anxiety and also itch caused by allergies, is associated with fast, chaotic heartbeats. We reviewed data from a drug safety database and the basic studies of hydroxyzine interactions with human cells. The drug safety data had 59 reports between December 1955 and August 2016 that linked fast chaotic heartbeats to hydroxyzine use. Some people took too much of the drug (overdose). All other cases had medical problems or were taking other drugs along with hydroxyzine. People who have heart problems and take drugs that can cause irregular heartbeat are at the greatest risk of complications due to hydroxyzine. Studies show hydroxyzine can effect some heart functions. Hydroxyzine should be listed as drug with ""conditional risk of torsade de pointes"". Hydroxyzine use in patients who are at risk for heart problems should be limited.",2,C
62,1683192,"First-generation antihistamines have potency, pharmacokinetic, and cost advantages compared with nonsedating second-generation antihistamines. Bedtime dosing of hydroxyzine was investigated as a dosing strategy to minimize reaction time degradation and adverse subjective symptoms previously documented for hydroxyzine in divided doses. Hydroxyzine, 50 mg qhs, was compared with terfenadine, 60 mg bid, in this double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study of 15 healthy, asymptomatic adults. Computer-based eye-hand reaction time tests of simple reaction time (SRT) and choice reaction time (CRT) were not statistically different among the three drugs. Drowsiness, dry mouth, and irritability were significant for hydroxyzine (P = .0001, .001 and .02, respectively) compared with terfenadine or placebo, but less than seen in a previous study of hydroxyzine, 25 mg bid. Symptom scores with terfenadine were comparable to placebo. Histamine skin test wheal and flare were both significantly and comparably suppressed by hydroxyzine and terfenadine (P = .0001). While wheal suppression by hydroxyzine was universal, four of the 15 subjects showed little or no suppression with terfenadine (P = .03). Although bedtime dosing of hydroxyzine did not eliminate subjective symptoms, it maintained skin H1-receptor antagonism the following morning and alleviated the prolongation of reaction times previously reported with hydroxyzine in divided doses. The significant adverse subjective symptoms and psychomotor performance degradations caused by first-generation antihistamines can be mitigated by creative dosing schedules.","First-generation antihistamines (allergy drugs that cause drowsiness) are more powerful and cheaper than the second-generation antihistamines that do not cause drowsiness. Hydroxyzine is an antihistamine that is used to relieve itching caused by allergies. We studied if taking hydroxyzine at bedtime reduces the side effects known to be caused by taking this drug divided in small doses. 15 healthy adults took hydroxyzine every night at bedtime or another antihistamine terfenadine or a pill that contained no drugs two times a day.  Hydroxyzine caused drowsiness, dry mouth and moodiness more than terfenadine or placebo, but less than taking hydroxyzine twice a day. Symptoms caused by terfenadine and placebo were about the same. Both hydroxyzine and terfenadine lessened allergic reactions. Hydroxyzine lessened allergic reactions in all people, but terfenadine failed to lessen the reaction in four of the 15 people. Taking hydroxyzine at bedtime somewhat lessened the symptoms and relieved skin itching the next morning. The side effects lasted not as long as with taking the drug twice daily. The side effects and sluggish movements caused by the first-generation antihistamines can be lessened by changing when the drug is taken.",2,C
62,8792380,"Although older, potentially sedating, ""first-generation"" antihistamines (H1-receptor antagonists) are commonly used in childhood, their central nervous system (CNS) effects have not been well-documented in young subjects. We hypothesized that diphenhydramine and hydroxyzine would affect CNS function adversely in this population. Our objective was to evaluate the effects of these medications on central and peripheral histamine H1-receptors in children. Fifteen subjects with allergic rhinitis were tested before and 2-2.5 h after administration of diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine, or placebo in a double-blind, single-dose, three-way crossover study. Impairment of cognitive processing was assessed objectively by the latency of the P300 event-related potential (P300). Somnolence was assessed subjectively by a visual analog scale. Peripheral H1-blockade was assessed by suppression of the histamine-induced wheals and flares. At the central (Cz) and frontal (Fz) electrodes, diphenhydramine and hydroxyzine increased the P300 latency significantly (P < 0.05) compared to baseline. Hydroxyzine increased somnolence, as recorded on the visual analog scale, significantly compared to baseline (P < 0.05), with a similar trend for diphenhydramine (P = 0.07). Both antihistamines reduced histamine-induced wheals and flares significantly compared to baseline and compared to placebo. In children, diphenhydramine and hydroxyzine are effective H1-receptor antagonists, but both these medications cause CNS dysfunction, as evidenced by increased P300 latency, a measure of cognitive function, and by increased subjective somnolence.","First generation antihistamines, drugs that stop allergies due to the body chemical histamine, may cause drowsiness. They are often given to children, but it is not known how they effect the children's brains We believe that first generation antihistamines diphenhydramine and hydroxyzine may disturb children's brain function. We evaluated how these drugs effect body cells in children. Fifteen children with seasonal allergy (hay fever) had tests before and after they took diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine, or placebo (a pill that contains no drugs.) Their brain functions were evaluated by measuring the delays in response to events. They were also asked to evaluate how sleepy they felt.  Diphenhydramine and hydroxyzine significantly increased the time it took to respond to the events. Hydroxyzine and diphenhydramine also increased sleepiness. Both antihistamines also reduced the allergies. In children, diphenhydramine and hydroxyzine help against allergies, but interfere with brain functions. These drugs cause longer response times, increase sleepiness and disturb mental processes.",2,C
62,7913608,"First-generation histamine H1-receptor antagonists, such as diphenhydramine, triprolidine, hydroxyzine or chlorpheniramine (chlorphenamine), frequently cause somnolence or other CNS adverse effects. Second-generation H1-antagonists, such as terfenadine, astemizole, loratadine and cetirizine, represent a true advance in therapeutics. In manufacturers' recommended doses, they have a more favourable benefit/risk ratio than their predecessors with regard to lack of CNS effects, and do not exacerbate the adverse CNS effects of alcohol or other CNS-active chemicals. Rarely, some of the newer H1-antagonists may cause cardiac dysrhythmias after overdose or under other specific conditions. The concept of a risk-free H1-antagonist is proving to be an oversimplification. An H1-antagonist absolutely free from adverse effects under all circumstances is not yet available for use. The magnitude of the beneficial effects of each H1-antagonist should be related to the magnitude of the unwanted effects, especially in the CNS and cardiovascular system, and a benefit-risk ratio or therapeutic index should be developed for each medication in this class.","First-generation antihistamines, drugs that help with allergies caused by histamine, a chemical profited by our bodies, often cause sleepiness and disturb brain functions in other ways. These drugs include diphenhydramine, triprolidine, hydroxyzine and chlorpheniramine (chlorphenamine). Second-generation antihistamines, such as terfenadine, astemizole, loratadine and cetirizine, are better. These drugs do not disturb brain functions when taken alone, and do not strengthen the disturbances caused by alcohol or other chemicals. Not often, the new antihistamines may cause heart rhythm disturbances; if a person takes too much of the drug or has other specific conditions. Taking any antihistamines includes some risks.  When taking antihistamines, people should consider the benefits and the risks carefully. ",2,C
62,29532516,"Objective: Antihistamines often have sedative side effects. This was the first study to measure regional cerebral glucose (energy) consumption and hemodynamic responses in young adults during cognitive tests after antihistamine administration. Methods: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-way crossover study, 18 healthy young Japanese men received single doses of levocetirizine 5 mg and diphenhydramine 50 mg at intervals of at least six days. Subjective feeling, task performances, and brain activity were evaluated during three cognitive tests (word fluency, two-back, and Stroop). Regional cerebral glucose consumption changes were measured using positron emission tomography with [18 F]fluorodeoxyglucose. Regional hemodynamic responses were measured using near-infrared spectroscopy. Results: Energy consumption in prefrontal regions was significantly increased after antihistamine administration, especially diphenhydramine, whereas prefrontal hemodynamic responses, evaluated with oxygenated hemoglobin levels, were significantly lower with diphenhydramine treatment. Stroop test accuracy was significantly impaired by diphenhydramine, but not by levocetirizine. There was no significant difference in subjective sleepiness. Conclusions: Physiological ""coupling"" between metabolism and perfusion in the healthy human brain may not be maintained under pharmacological influence due to antihistamines. This uncoupling may be caused by a combination of increased energy demands in the prefrontal regions and suppression of vascular permeability in brain capillaries after antihistamine treatment. Further research is needed to validate this hypothesis.","Antihistamines, drugs that help with allergies, often cause drowsiness. We studied young adults' brains during tests of mental processes after taking antihistamines. 18 healthy young Japanese men took antihistamines levocetirizine and diphenhydramine at least six days apart.

Diphenhydramine, but not levocetirizine, lowered the accuracy of mental processes. There was no difference in sleepiness. Antihistamines may effect human brain.  ",2,C
62,7486360,"Study objective: To evaluate the efficacy of a 4-day ""burst"" course of prednisone added to standard treatment with H1 antihistamines for the management of acute urticaria in outpatients. Design: Prospective, randomized, double-blinded, clinical trial. Setting: Emergency department of an urban tertiary care teaching hospital. Participants: Adult patients with urticarial rash of no more than 24 hours' duration, regardless of cause. Patients were excluded if they manifested wheezing, stridor, or angioedema or if they had taken antihistamines or glucocorticoids within 5 days of arrival at the ED. Patients also were excluded if there was a history of diabetes or active peptic ulcer disease. Interventions: All patients were asked to evaluate the severity of pruritus (""itch score"") on a 10-cm visual analog scale. Patients were then given diphenhydramine, 50 mg intramuscularly, and discharged home on a regimen of hydroxyzine, 25 mg orally, every 4 to 8 hours for pruritus, plus either prednisone, 20 mg, or placebo orally every 12 hours for 4 days. Patients' conditions were reassessed clinically, with itch score calculated again 2 days later, and again at 5 days by telephone. Results: Forty-three patients were enrolled; 24 received prednisone and 19 received placebo. The two groups had similar itch scores at enrollment (prednisone, 8.1 +/- 1.7; placebo, 7.4 +/- 2.1, P = .25 [ANOVA]), but at 2- and 5-day follow-up the prednisone group had significantly lower itch scores (1.3 +/- 1.3 and .0 +/- .0 versus 4.4 +/- 2.2 and 1.6 +/- 1.0, respectively; P < .0001 [ANCOVA] at each interval) and greater clinical improvement in rash. Response did not correlate with age, sex, or identification of an allergen. No adverse effects were noted in either group.

Diabetics and people with ulcers (open sores in the stomach) were not included too. All patients were asked to give their itch an ""itch score"" on a scale. Patients then got a shot of an antihistamine diphenhydramine and were sent home. They took an antihistamine hydroxyzine every 4 to 8 hours for their itch. Patients also took another pill every 12 hours for 4 days. For some that pill was the hormone prednisone, and for some it was a placebo (did not contain any drug). Patients came back to evaluate their each score 2 days later. 5 days later the score was evaluated by phone. Out of f43 patients, 24 got prednisone and 19 placebo. All had similar each scores at the beginning. After 2 and 5 days, those who had prednisone had lower itch scores and less rash. Patients' age, sex, and substances that caused allergies did not effect the itch score. No patients had adverse reactions. Adding prednisone improves antihistamine treatment of hives. When prednisone was added, the skin cleared faster and more completely. There were no side effects. ",2,C
62,2866055,"This article reviews clinical pharmacokinetic data on the H1-receptor antagonists, commonly referred to as the antihistamines. Despite their widespread use over an extended period, relatively little pharmacokinetic data are available for many of these drugs. A number of H1-receptor antagonists have been assayed mainly using radioimmunoassay methods. These have also generally measured metabolites to greater or lesser extents. Thus, the interpretation of such data is complex. After oral administration of H1-receptor antagonists as syrup or tablet formulations, peak plasma concentrations are usually observed after 2 to 3 hours. Bioavailability has not been extensively studied, but is about 0.34 for chlorpheniramine, 0.40 to 0.60 for diphenhydramine, and about 0.25 for promethazine. Most of these drugs are metabolised in the liver, this being very extensive in some instances (e.g. cyproheptadine and terfenadine). Total body clearance in adults is generally in the range of 5 to 12 ml/min/kg (for astemizole, brompheniramine, chlorpheniramine, diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine, promethazine and triprolidine), while their elimination half-lives range from about 3 hours to about 18 days [cinnarizine about 3 hours; diphenhydramine about 4 hours; promethazine 10 to 14 hours; chlorpheniramine 14 to 25 hours; hydroxyzine about 20 hours; brompheniramine about 25 hours; astemizole and its active metabolites about 7 to 20 days (after long term administration); flunarizine about 18 to 20 days]. They also have relatively large apparent volumes of distribution in excess of 4 L/kg. In children, the elimination half-lives of chlorpheniramine and hydroxyzine are shorter than in adults. In patients with alcohol-related liver disease, the elimination half-life of diphenhydramine was increased from 9 to 15 hours, while in patients with chronic renal disease that of chlorpheniramine was very greatly prolonged. Little, if any, published information is available on the pharmacokinetics of these drugs in neonates, pregnancy or during lactation. The relatively long half-lives of a number of the older H1-receptor antagonists such as brompheniramine, chlorpheniramine and hydroxyzine suggest that they can be administered to adults once daily.","This is a review of the drugs called antihistamines because they help with allergies caused by the body chemical histamine. These drugs are used widely, but little is known about their interactions with human body.   The max amount of antihistamines gets into the blood 2 to 3 hours after taking a pill or syrup. The amounts of the drug that made it into the blood were about a third of the taken pill for chlorpheniramine, about half for diphenhydramine, and about a quarter for promethazine. Most of these drugs are processed in the body by the liver. These drugs are usually removed from the body at a rate of 5 to 12 milliliters per minute for each kilogram of body weight. Half of the total amount of the drug is taken out of the body from about 3 hours to about 20 days. For cinnarizine it's about 3 hours; diphenhydramine about 4 hours; promethazine 10 to 14 hours; chlorpheniramine 14 to 25 hours; hydroxyzine about 20 hours; brompheniramine about 25 hours; astemizole about 7 to 20 days, when taken for a long time; and for flunarizine about 18 to 20 days. These drugs tend to go from the blood into the body tissues, meaning that a higher dose of a drug is needed to keep its levels in the blood. In children, chlorpheniramine and hydroxyzine go to half of the amount in the body faster than in adults. In patients with liver disease due to alcohol, time to get half of the diphenhydramine out lengthens from 9 to 15 hours. In patients with kidney disease, time to get out chlorpheniramine was very greatly prolonged. Almost nothing is known about these drugs in the bodies of newborns, and pregnant or breastfeeding women. Because half of the drug stays in the body longer for the older antihistamines such as brompheniramine, chlorpheniramine and hydroxyzine, they can be given to adults once daily.",2,C
62,15507061,"Objectives: To determine the national rate and trend of inappropriate medication administration to elderly emergency department (ED) patients. Secondary objectives were to identify risk factors for receiving an inappropriate medication and to determine whether administration is sometimes justified based on diagnosis. Design: Retrospective analysis of ED visits in the 1992-2000 National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey. Inappropriate medications identified using Beers' 1997 explicit criteria. Setting: EDs of U.S. noninstitutionalized general and short-stay hospitals. Participants: ED survey patients aged 65 and older. Measurements: Magnitude and rate of administration of 36 medications.

Six drugs accounted for 70.8% of inappropriate administration: promethazine (22.2%), meperidine (18.0%), propoxyphene (17.2%), hydroxyzine (10.3%), diphenhydramine (7.1%), and diazepam (6.0%). In multivariate analysis, number of ED medications was the strongest predictor, with an odds ratio for two to three medications of 6.0 (95% CI=5.3-6.7) and for four to six medications of 8.1 (95% CI=7.2-9.2). Diagnoses indicating potentially appropriate uses of these medications were rarely present. For example, only 42.4% of patients receiving diphenhydramine and 7.4% receiving hydroxyzine were diagnosed with an allergic process. Conclusion: Elderly ED patients are frequently administered inappropriate medications. Potentially appropriate uses of generally inappropriate drugs cannot account for such administrations. Inappropriate administration rates remain unchanged despite the 1997 publication of explicit criteria.","We studied inappropriate use of drugs in elderly patients in the emergency departments. We also find out what causes inappropriate use of drugs and if it is sometimes done for a good reason. We studied visits to emergency departments in 1992-2000. Drugs that are dangerous for elderly and should be used with caution were listed by Dr. Beers in 1997.   Drugs from the Beers' list were given about 16 million times (over a tenth of emergency visits by elderly) from 1992 to 2000. Six drugs accounted for the majority of inappropriate use: promethazine, meperidine, propoxyphene, hydroxyzine, diphenhydramine, and diazepam. There were almost no indications that the use of these drugs was potentially appropriate. For example, less than half of patients that got diphenhydramine and less than 10th that got hydroxyzine had allergies. Elderly patients often get inappropriate drugs in the emergency room. Potentially appropriate uses do not account for the given drugs. Although the list of inappropriate drugs was published in 1997, it has not changed how the drugs are given. ",2,C
63,24197658,"The objective of this study was to examine the associations between aromatase inhibitor therapy and hair loss or hair thinning among female breast cancer survivors. Data were analyzed from 851 female breast cancer survivors who responded to a hospital registry-based survey. Data on hair loss, hair thinning, demographic characteristics, and health habits were based on self-report; data on aromatase inhibitor therapy were collected on the survey and verified using medical record review. Logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) for the associations between aromatase inhibitor therapy and the hair outcome variables adjusted for potential confounders, including age and chemotherapy treatment. The results showed that 22.4 % of the breast cancer survivors reported hair loss and 31.8 % reported hair thinning. In the confounder-adjusted analyses, breast cancer survivors who were within 2 years of starting aromatase inhibitor treatment at the time of survey completion were approximately two and a half times more likely to report reporting hair loss (OR 2.55; 95 % CI 1.19-5.45) or hair thinning (OR 2.33; 95 % CI 1.10-4.93) within the past 4 weeks compared to those who were never treated with an aromatase inhibitor. Current aromatase inhibitor use for two or more years at the time of the survey and prior use were significantly associated with hair thinning (current users, ≥2 years: OR 1.86; prior users: OR 1.62), but not hair loss. Findings from this study suggest that aromatase inhibitor use is associated with an increased risk of hair loss and hair thinning independent of chemotherapy and age; these side effects are likely due to the substantial decrease in estrogen concentrations resulting from treatment with this drug. Future research should focus on examining these associations in a prospective manner using more detailed and objective measures of hair loss and thinning.","This study examines the links between aromatase inhibitor therapy (drugs commonly used to treat breast cancer) and hair loss or hair thinning among female breast cancer survivors. We analyzed data from 851 female breast cancer survivors who responded to a hospital survey. Data on hair loss, hair thinning, background information, and health habits were self-reported. Data on aromatase inhibitor therapy were collected by the survey and verified with medical records. The relationship between aromatase inhibitor therapy and hair outcome was mathematically estimated and adjusted for possible misleading variables, like age and chemotherapy treatment. 22.4% of the breast cancer survivors reported hair loss. 31.8% reported hair thinning. Breast cancer survivors who were within 2 years of starting aromatase inhibitor treatment at the time of the survey were around two and a half times more likely to report hair loss or thinning in the past 4 weeks compared to those never treated with an aromatase inhibitor. Current aromatase inhibitor use for 2 or more years at the time of the survey and past use were linked with hair thinning but not hair loss. Findings from the study suggest that aromatase inhibitor use is linked with an increased risk of hair loss and thinning regardless of chemotherapy and age. These side effects are likely from the reduction in estrogen (a female sex hormone) from the drug treatment. Future research should examine the links in a future-oriented manner with more detailed and measurable measures of hair loss and thinning.",2,C
63,29641806,"Importance: Endocrine therapy-induced alopecia (EIA) has been anecdotally reported but not systematically described. Objective: To characterize EIA in patients with breast cancer. Design, setting, and participants: Retrospective cohort study of 112 patients with breast cancer, diagnosed with EIA from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2016, the patients were examined at the dermatology service in a large tertiary care hospital and comprehensive cancer center. Main outcomes and measures: The clinical features, alopecia-related quality of life (QoL), and response to minoxidil of EIA in patients with breast cancer were assessed. Data from the Hairdex Questionnaire was used to assess the impact of the alopecia on patients QoL.  Higher score indicates lower QoL (0-100 score). Efficacy of minoxidil was measured at 3 or 6 months by a single-blinded investigator through standardized clinical photographs of the scalp. Results: A total of 112 female patients with breast cancer were included (median [range] age, 60 [34-90] years). A total of 104 patients (93%) had standardized clinical photographs; of these, 59 patients (53%) had trichoscopy images available at baseline, and 46 patients (41%) were assessed for response to minoxidil. Alopecia was attributed to aromatase inhibitors in 75 patients (67%) and tamoxifen in 37 (33%). Severity was grade 1 in 96 of 104 patients (92%), and the pattern was similar to androgenetic alopecia. The predominant trichoscopic feature at baseline was the presence of vellus hairs and intermediate- and thick-diameter terminal hair shafts. A negative impact on QoL was reported, with a higher effect in the emotion domain according to the Hairdex score (mean [SD], 41.8 [21.3]; P < .001). After treatment with topical minoxidil, moderate or significant improvement in alopecia was observed in 37 of 46 patients (80%). Conclusions and relevance: Endocrine therapies are associated with a pattern alopecia similar to androgenetic-type, consistent with the mechanism of action of causal agents. A significant negative impact on QoL was reported by patients, despite mostly mild alopecia severity.","The study's importance is based on the fact that endocrine therapy-induced alopecia (EIA) (hair loss or thinning from hormonal therapy) has been mentioned but not measured. The study's objective is to describe EIA thoroughly in patients with breast cancer. The study's design is a study of 112 patients with breast cancer, diagnosed with EIA from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2016. The patients were examined at a skin center in a large, specialized hospital and professional cancer center. The study's main variables included common hospital measures, hair-loss- or hair-thinning-related quality of life (QoL), and reaction to minoxidil (hair regrowth medication) of EIA in patients with breast cancer. We used data from the Hairdex Questionnaire (a questionnaire for disease-specific quality of life measurements) to measure the impact of hair loss or thinning (alopecia) on patients QoL. Higher scores indicate lower QoL (0-100 score). The success of minoxidil was measured at 3 or 6 months by an investigator unaware of the treatment groups through standard photographs of the scalp. 112 female patients with breast cancer were included. Their median age was 60 years with a range from 34-90 years. 104 patients (93%) had standard photographs. Of these, 59 patients (53%) had images from special hair and scalp evaluations at the start. 46 patients (41%) were measured for response to minoxidil. Alopecia was linked to aromatase inhibitors in 75 patients (67%) and tamoxifen (estrogen-influencing medication) in 37 (33%). Severity was low in 96 of 104 patients (92%). The pattern was similar to common, receding hair loss. The most common scalp and hair-related feature at the start were peach fuzz and mid- and thick, long hairs on the scalp. QoL was negatively reported, especially in the emotional part of life. After treatment with minoxidil on the skin, medium or noticeable improvement in hair loss and thinning was seen in 37 of 46 patients (80%). In conclusion, hormonal therapies are linked with commonly-seen hair loss and thinning, similar to agents that actively cause alopecia. Despite mostly mild alopecia, QoL was negatively impacted for patients.",2,C
63,27247882,"Endocrine therapy-induced hair loss (ETIHL) associated with aromatase inhibitors and tamoxifen treatment is currently mostly reported but remained an unresolved therapeutic issue in patients with breast cancer (BC) since the number of studies regarding the management is limited in literature. Herein we investigated the possible causes of this clinical problem and its relation with endocrine therapies widely used for BC survivors and made some modest practical recommendations in light of the literature review in order to provide an optimal management. On the basis of literature findings, common causes of hair loss apart from endocrine therapies should be investigated with an initial evaluation workup and then should be corrected, if observed. Treatment with topical 5-alpha reductase inhibitors and supplementation of Vitamin C and omega-3 fatty acids are likely appeared to be the most appropriate treatment agents for ETIHL without causing an adverse effect on BC prognosis. However, more prospective, randomised, placebo-controlled studied are required in order to confirm our results and also identify the clinical effects of this problem on patients with BC.","Endocrine therapy-induced hair loss (ETIHL) (hair loss from hormonal therapy) linked with aromatase inhibitors (drugs used to treat breast cancer) and tamoxifen (estrogen-influencing medication) is reported but remains unsolved in patients with breast cancer (BC).

We checked the possible causes of this medical problem and its link to hormonal therapies used for BC survivors. We also made practical recommendations based on relevant medical studies to provide optimal management. Based on medical papers, common causes of hair loss besdies hormonal therapies should be checked with a starting evaluation workup and then corrected if found. Treatment with 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (drugs for treating hair loss) applied on skin and Vitamin C and omega-3 fatty acid supplements may be the best treatment for ETIHL without causing serious side effects on BC recovery.

63,25473228,"We report five cases of pattern alopecia in female patients who are undergoing hormonal anticancer therapy for the prevention of recurrence of breast cancer after surgery. Three patients demonstrated male pattern alopecia with receding frontal hairlines, and two patients demonstrated female pattern alopecia without receding hairlines. The detailed clinical history showed that the pattern alopecia of the patients developed after the full recovery of global hair loss of the entire scalp due to previous cytotoxic chemotherapy. All of the adjuvant hormonal anticancer drugs that were used in the patients are antiestrogenic agents, either aromatase inhibitors or selective estrogen receptor modulators. Considering androgen effect on the hair follicles of the fronto-parietal scalp, the androgen-estrogen imbalance caused by the drugs was thought to be the reason for the onset of pattern alopecia in the patients. In general, alopecia that develops during cytotoxic chemotherapy is well known to both physicians and patients; however, the diagnosis of pattern alopecia during hormonal anticancer therapy in breast cancer patients seems to be overlooked.","We report 5 cases of common alopecia (hair loss or thinning) in female patients undergoing hormonal anticancer therapy to prevent reoccuring breast cancer after surgery.

63,30464397,"Background and objective: Anastrozole is a well-established active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) used for the treatment of hormone-sensitive breast cancer (BC) in postmenopausal women. However, treatment with the only available oral formulation is often associated with concentration-dependent serious side effects such as hot flashes, fatigue, muscle and joint pain, nausea, diarrhea, headache, and others. In contrast, a sustained-release system for the local application of anastrozole should minimize these serious adverse drug reactions. Methods: Anastrozole-in-adhesive transdermal drug delivery systems (TDDS) were developed offering efficient loading, avoidance of inhomogeneity or crystallization of the drug, the desired controlled release kinetics, storage stability, easy handling, mechanical stability, and sufficient stickiness on the skin. In vitro continuous anastrozole release profiles were studied in Franz diffusion cells. In vivo, consecutive drug plasma kinetics from the final anastrozole transdermal system was tested in beagle dogs. For drug analysis, a specific validated liquid chromatography- mass spectrometry method using fragment ion detection was developed and validated. Results: After efficient drug loading, a linear and sustained 65% drug release from the TDDS over 48 h was obtained. In vivo data showed a favorable anastrozole plasma concentration-time course, avoiding side effect-associated peak concentrations as obtained after oral administration but matching therapeutic plasma levels up to 72 h. Conclusion: These results provide the basis for establishing the transdermal application of anastrozole with improved pharmacokinetics and drug safety as novel therapeutic approach and promising option to treat human BC by decreasing the high burden of unwanted side effects.","For background, anastrozole is an important drug ingredient for treatment of hormone-sensitive breast cancer (BC) in women who have finished their last period. However, treatment with the only available drug taken by mouth is linked with serious side effects that worsen with greater doses. These side effects include hot flashes, fatigue, muscle and joint pain, nausea, diarrhea, headache, and others. In contrast, a steady release of anastrozole could minimize these serious side effects from the drug. Anastrozole administered by a patch on the skin was created for efficient administration, avoiding drug crystals in the body, desired drug release, storage ease, easy handling, stability, and stickiness on the skin. Continuous anastrozole treatment was studied in cells designed to measure the success of oils, creams, and gels. Drug reactions in blood from the final anastrozole treatment on skin was tested in beagle dogs. To analyze the drug, a specific filtration method was created and verified. After enough drug exposure, a sustained 65% drug release from the skin treatment over 48 hours was obtained. Data in living animals showed good anastrozole blood concentration overtime, avoiding the worst of side effects linked with treatment by mouth but matching its helpful blood levels up to 72 hours. In conclusion, applying anastrozole by skin shows improved drug reactions and safety. The treatment is a promising option to treat human BC by reducing unwanted side effects.",2,C
63,20821047,"Previous studies have demonstrated that both anastrozole and letrozole are well tolerated. Letrozole suppresses estrogen to a greater degree than anastrozole in the serum and breast tumor. Concerns have been raised that greater potency may adversely affect patients' quality of life (QOL). One hundred eighty-one postmenopausal women with invasive estrogen receptor-positive breast cancers were randomized to receive either 12 weeks of letrozole followed by 12 weeks of anastrozole or the reverse sequence. One hundred and six received immediate adjuvant aromatase inhibitors (AIs) following surgery, and 75 received extended adjuvant therapy. The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Endocrine Subscale (FACT-B-ES) QOL questionnaires were completed to assess QOL on each drug. Additional side-effect profiles were collected. Each patient completed a patient preference form. Twenty-one patients withdrew before study end, 10/179 (5.6%) while taking letrozole and 4/173 (2.3%) while taking anastrozole (P = 0.12). Tamoxifen-naïve patients had a higher mean ES (endocrine symptoms subscale) score at entry versus those having extended therapy (66.0 vs. 61.9; P = 0.001). There was no significant change in FACT-B-ES (overall) scores or ES scores while patients were taking anastrozole or letrozole and no significant differences between drugs.

63,24037977,"Background: Whereas the frequency of alopecia to cytotoxic chemotherapies has been well described, the incidence of alopecia during endocrine therapies (i.e., anti-estrogens, aromatase inhibitors) has not been investigated. Endocrine agents are widely used in the treatment and prevention of many solid tumors, principally those of the breast and prostate. Adherence to these therapies is suboptimal, in part because of toxicities. We performed a systematic analysis of the literature to ascertain the incidence and risk for alopecia in patients receiving endocrine therapies. Results: Data from 19,430 patients in 35 clinical trials were available for analysis. Of these, 13,415 patients had received endocrine treatments and 6,015 patients served as controls. The incidence of all-grade alopecia ranged from 0% to 25%, with an overall incidence of 4.4% (95% confidence interval: 3.3%-5.9%). The highest incidence of all-grade alopecia was observed in patients treated with tamoxifen in a phase II trial (25.4%); similarly, the overall incidence of grade 2 alopecia by meta-analysis was highest with tamoxifen (6.4%). The overall relative risk of alopecia in comparison with placebo was 12.88 (p < .001), with selective estrogen receptor modulators having the highest risk. Conclusion: Alopecia is a common yet underreported adverse event of endocrine-based cancer therapies. Their long-term use heightens the importance of this condition on patients' quality of life. These findings are critical for pretherapy counseling, the identification of risk factors, and the development of interventions that could enhance adherence and mitigate this psychosocially difficult event.","For the study's background, while the frequency of alopecia (hair loss or thinning) to powerful chemotherapies (cancer-treating treatments) has been well described, the frequency of alopecia during hormonal therapies (i.e., anti-estrogens, aromatase inhibitors used to treat breast cancer) has not been described. Hormonal agents are widely used in the treatment and prevention of many solid tumors, mainly those of the breast and prostrate. Sticking to these therapies is not the best, In part due to toxicities. We analyzed scientific papers to measure the frequency and risk for alopecia in patients receiving hormonal therapies. Data from 19,430 patients in 35 clinical trials were available for analysis. Of these, 13,415 patients got hormonal treatments. 6,015 did not. The frequency of any alopecia ranged from 0% to 25%, with an overall frequency of 4.4%. The highest frequency of any alopecia was seen in patients treated with tamoxifen (an estrogen-influencing drug) in a clinical trial (25.4%). Similarly, the overall frequency of severe alopecia in the analysis was highest with tamoxifen (6.4%). The overall risk of alopecia compared with sham treatment was 12.88, with specific estrogen-receptor influencers having the highest risk. In conclusion, alopecia is a common yet rarely-mentioned side effect of hormonal cancer therapies. Their long-term use increases the importance of this condition on patients' quality of life.

Median age was 64 years (35-89), median follow-up 53 months (6-60). Prior adjuvant chemotherapy was taxane based in 47 patients and anthracycline based in 43 patients. 118 patients had received letrozole, 101 anastrozole, and 17 exemestane. Results: Twenty-four patients (10%) needed discontinuation of the first AI assigned as a result of toxicity. Grade 2/3 arthralgia was the main reason for discontinuation in 13/24 patients. No differences in the incidence of arthralgia were noted in patients who had received taxanes or anthracyclines. Headache, alopecia, itching, diffuse skin reaction, allergic reaction with hypertensive crisis, xerostomia and xerophthalmia, insomnia and somnolence were the other reasons for discontinuation.

Alternative HT (AI or tamoxifen) was offered to patients who wanted or needed to permanently interrupt the ongoing drug. Conclusions: In our analysis, 10% of patients discontinued the first AI assigned because of toxicity. Median time course of all adverse events leading to HT discontinuation was 155 days and 135 days for arthralgia.

We have therefore investigated whether neoadjuvant gefitinib, an EGFR inhibitor, might overcome biologic and clinical resistance to neoadjuvant anastrozole in a phase II placebo-controlled trial. Patients and methods: Postmenopausal women with stage I to IIIB hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer received anastrozole 1 mg daily for 16 weeks and were randomly assigned at a ratio of 2:5:5 to receive, in addition, gefitinib 250 mg/d orally for 16 weeks: placebo 1 tablet/d orally for 2 weeks and then gefitinib for 14 weeks or placebo for 16 weeks. The primary end point was biologic change in proliferation as measured by Ki67 at 2 and 16 weeks; the main secondary end point was overall objective response (OR). Results: Two hundred six women were randomly assigned. Mean changes in Ki67 with anastrozole and gefitinib versus anastrozole alone were -77.4% and -83.6%, respectively, between baseline and 16 weeks (geometric mean ratio = 1.37; 95% CI, 0.79 to 2.39; P = .26), -80.1% and -71.3% between baseline and 2 weeks (geometric mean ratio = 0.70; 95% CI, 0.39 to 1.25; P = .22) and -19.3% and -43% (geometric mean ratio = 1.42; 95% CI, 0.86 to 2.35; P = .16) between 2 and 16 weeks.

64,35074891,"Background and objectives: Pathogenic variants in the neuronal sodium-channel Î±1-subunit gene (SCN1A) are the most frequent monogenic cause of epilepsy. Phenotypes comprise a wide clinical spectrum including the severe childhood epilepsy, Dravet syndrome, characterized by drug-resistant seizures, intellectual disability and high mortality, and the milder genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+), characterized by normal cognition. Early recognition of a child's risk for developing Dravet syndrome versus GEFS+ is key for implementing disease-modifying therapies when available before cognitive impairment emerges. Our objective was to develop and validate a prediction model using clinical and genetic biomarkers for early diagnosis of SCN1A-related epilepsies. Methods: Retrospective multicenter cohort study comprising data from SCN1A-positive Dravet syndrome and GEFS+ patients consecutively referred for genetic testing (March 2001-June 2020) including age of seizure onset and a newly-developed SCN1A genetic score. A training cohort was used to develop multiple prediction models that were validated using two independent blinded cohorts. Primary outcome was the discriminative accuracy of the model predicting Dravet syndrome versus other GEFS+ phenotypes. Results: 1018 participants were included. The frequency of Dravet syndrome was 616/743 (83%) in the training cohort, 147/203 (72%) in validation cohort 1 and 60/72 (83%) in validation cohort 2. A high SCN1A genetic score 133.4 (SD, 78.5) versus 52.0 (SD, 57.5; p < 0.001) and young age of onset 6.0 (SD, 3.0) months versus 14.8 (SD, 11.8; p < 0.001) months, were each associated with Dravet syndrome versus GEFS+. A combined 'SCN1A genetic score and seizure onset' model separated Dravet syndrome from GEFS+ more effectively (area under the curve [AUC], 0.89 [95% CI, 0.86-0.92]) and outperformed all other models (AUC, 0.79-0.85; p < 0.001). Model performance was replicated in both validation cohorts 1 (AUC, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.91-0.97]) and 2 (AUC, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.82-1.00]). Discussion: The prediction model allows objective estimation at disease onset whether a child will develop Dravet syndrome versus GEFS+, assisting clinicians with prognostic counseling and decisions on early institution of precision therapies (http://scn1a-prediction-model.broadinstitute.org/). Classification of evidence: This study provides Class II evidence that a combined 'SCN1A genetic score and seizure onset' model distinguishes Dravet syndrome from other GEFS+ phenotypes.","For the study's background, we studied disease-causing types of the brain-located gene called SCN1A, which is the most frequent cause of epileptic seizures or epilepsy. Physical attributes make up a wide spectrum including the severe childhood epilepsy, Dravet syndrome, epilepsy characterized by drug-resistant seizures, lower intelligence, and high death risk, and the milder genetic epilepsy with fever-like seizures plus (GEFS+), characterized by normal intelligence. Early identification of a child's risk for developing Dravet syndrome versus GEFS+ is key for giving disease-modifying treatments when available before intelligence impairment come up. Our objective was to develop and verify a disease prediction model using medical and genetic biomarkers for early identification of SCN1A-related epilepsies. For the study's methods, it was a multicenter group study comprising data from previous SCN1A-positive Dravet syndrome and GEFS+ patients consistently treated with genetic testing (March 2001-June 2020). Data includes age of seizure start and a newly-developed SCN1A genetic score. A training group was used to develop multiple disease prediction models that were verified using two independent groups. The main measure was the accuracy of the model predicting Dravet syndrome versus other GEFS+ phenotypes. 1018 participants were included. The frequency of Dravet syndrome was 616/743 (83%) in the training group, 147/203 (72%) in test group 1 and 60/72 (83%) in test group 2. A high SCN1A genetic score - 133.4 versus 52.0 - and young age of start - 6.0 months versus 14.8 months - were each linked with Dravet syndrome versus GEFS+. A combined 'SCN1A genetic score and seizure onset' model separated Dravet syndrome from GEFS+ more effectively and outperformed all other models. Model performance was replicated in both test group 1 and 2. In short, the prediction model allows measurable estimation at disease start whether a child will develop Dravet syndrome versus GEFS+, helping clinicians with treatment counseling and decisions on early use of specific treatments. This study provides strong evidence that a combined 'SCN1A genetic score and seizure onset' model identifies Dravet syndrome from other GEFS+ phenotypes.",2,C
64,35091117,"Background: The EPIGENE network was created in 2014 by four multidisciplinary teams composed of geneticists, pediatric neurologists and neurologists specialized in epileptology and neurophysiology. The ambition of the network was to harmonize and improve the diagnostic strategy of Mendelian epileptic disorders using next-generation sequencing, in France. Over the years, five additional centers have joined EPIGENE and the network has been working in close collaboration, since 2018, with the French reference center for rare epilepsies (CRÃ©ER). Results: Since 2014, biannual meetings have led to the design of four successive versions of a monogenic epilepsy gene panel (PAGEM), increasing from 68 to 144 genes. A total of 4035 index cases with epileptic disorders have been analyzed with a diagnostic yield of 31% (n = 1265/4035). The top 10 genes, SCN1A, KCNQ2, STXBP1, SCN2A, SCN8A, PRRT2, PCDH19, KCNT1, SYNGAP1, and GRIN2A, account for one-sixth of patients and half of the diagnoses provided by the PAGEM. Conclusion: These results suggest that a gene-panel approach is an efficient first-tier test for the genetic diagnosis of Mendelian epileptic disorders. In a near future, French patients with ""drug-resistant epilepsies with seizure-onset in the first two-years of life"" can benefit from whole-genome sequencing (WGS), as a second line genetic screening with the implementation of the 2025 French Genomic Medicine Plan.

64,34135856,"Background: Glucose-transporter-1 deficiency syndrome (GLUT1-DS), due to SLC2A1 gene mutation, is characterized by early-onset seizures, which are often drug-resistant, developmental delay, and hypotonia. Hemiplegic migraine (HM) is a rare form of migraine, defined by headache associated with transient hemiplegia, and can be caused by mutations in either CACNA1A, ATP1A2, or SCN1A. Paroxysmal movements, other transient neurological disorders, or hemiplegic events can occur in GLUT1-DS patients with a mild phenotype. Case: We report on a girl with GLUT1-DS, due to SLC2A1 mutation, with a mild phenotype. In early childhood, she developed epilepsy and mild cognitive impairment, balance disorders, and clumsiness. At the age of 9, the patient reported a first hemiplegic episode, which regressed spontaneously. Over the next 3 years, two similar episodes occurred, accompanied by headache. Therefore, in the hypothesis of HM, genetic testing was performed and CACNA1A mutation was identified. The treatment with Lamotrigine avoided the recurrence of HM episodes. Discussion: To our knowledge, among the several cases of GLUT1-DS with HM symptoms described in the literature, genetic testing was only performed in two of them, which eventually proved to be negative. In all other cases, no other genes except for SLC2A1 were examined. Consequently, our patient would be the first description of GLUT1-DS with HM due to CACNA1A mutation.

Methods: Several genomic approaches were used including genetic mapping of disease loci in multiplex or consanguineous families, TES then WES. Sanger sequencing was performed to identify or validate variants. Results: We achieved disease gene identification in 52.7% of AMC index patients including nine recently identified genes (CNTNAP1, MAGEL2, ADGRG6, ADCY6, GLDN, LGI4, LMOD3, UNC50 and SCN1A). Moreover, we identified pathogenic variants in ASXL3 and STAC3 expanding the phenotypes associated with these genes. The most frequent cause of AMC was a primary involvement of skeletal muscle (40%) followed by brain (22%). The most frequent mode of inheritance is autosomal recessive (66.3% of patients).

In particular, within the PUFAs category, omega-3 (ω-3) may reduce inflammation, whereas omega-6 (ω-6) PUFAs are generally considered to have a proinflammatory effect. Recent evidence highlights an imbalance in the ω-3:ω-6 ratio with an increased intake of ω-6, as a consequence of the shift towards a westernized diet. In critical age groups such as infants, toddlers and young children, as well as pregnant and lactating women or fish allergic patients, ω-3 intake may be inadequate. This review aims to discuss the potential beneficial effects of PUFAs on pediatric food allergy prevention and treatment, both at prenatal and postnatal ages. Data from preclinical studies with PUFAs supplementation show encouraging effects in suppressing allergic response. Clinical studies results are still conflicting about the best timing and dosages of supplementation and which individuals are most likely to benefit; therefore, it is still not possible to draw firm conclusions. With regard to food-allergic children, it is still debated whether PUFAs could slow disease progression or not, since consistent data are lacking. In conclusion, more data on the effects of ω-3 PUFAs supplementation alone or in combination with other nutrients are warranted, both in the general and food allergic population.","Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are involved both in immune system monitoring or regulation and infection-fighting processes such as inflammation.

The knowledge about modifiable risk factors, such as diet, can be an acceptable, cheap and non-pharmacological prevention tool. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between dietary fat, dietary fatty acids, fish intake, and breast cancer in women. Patients and methods: A case-control study was designed. A total of 201 consecutive, newly diagnosed, polish female cancer patients (mean age: 58 years) and 201 one-to-one age-matched controls were enrolled. A standardized questionnaire assessing various socio-demographic, clinical, lifestyle, and dietary characteristics was applied via face-to-face interviews. Detailed dietary intake information was assessed using a validated Food Frequency Questionnaire. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were obtained using multiple unconditional logistic regression models controlling for non-dietary and dietary potential confounders. Results: Consumption of polyunsaturated fats (PUFA) over 10% of total energy intake was associated with a significantly lower risk of breast cancer compared to low intake of PUFA (OR=0.4, 95%CI=0.19-0.85). Low (<0.2) omega-3/ omega-6 ratio (OR=2.04, 95%CI=0.996-4.17), fish consumption less than once every six months (OR=3.37, 95%CI=1.57-7.23) and being overweight (OR=2.07, 95%CI=1.3-3.3) were associated with increased risk of breast cancer. Residents of rural areas had a significantly higher risk compared to women from urban areas (OR=1.8, 95%CI=1.06-3.03). Conclusion: High intake of PUFA can decrease the risk of breast cancer, while the low omega-3/omega-6 ratio increases the risk.

Total plasma omega-3 fatty acids (Sigmaw3), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and high density lipoprotein (HDL) concentrations were significantly lower and the Sigmaomega-6/Sigmaomega-3 ratio was significantly higher in cases than in controls. The odds in favor of mental retardation increased by 69 % for each unit increase in the Sigmaomega-6/ Sigmaomega-3 ratio (adjusted odds ratio = 1.69, 95% CI = 1.25-2.29). Significant variation in plasma Sigmaomega-3 and the Sigmaomega-6/ Sigmaomega-3 ratio was explained by mental retardation and plasma HDL concentrations (45% and 37 % respectively). There was a significant inverse association between plasma DHA and mental retardation. For each unit increase in plasma DHA, odds of mental retardation decreased by 74 %. There was no significant difference in either total dietary fat or fatty acids intakes between cases and controls. The energy intake of cases was significantly higher than the controls.

Objective: In a racially diverse cohort, we hypothesized that childhood atopic dermatitis would be associated with higher prenatal omega-6 (n-6) and lower omega-3 (n-3) PUFAs. Methods: We included mother-child dyads, births 2006 to 2011, enrolled in the University of Tennessee Health Sciences Center Conditions Affecting Neurocognitive Development in Early Childhood cohort. Primary exposures included second trimester plasma n-3 and n-6 PUFA status and the ratio of the two (n-6:n-3). We assessed child current atopic dermatitis symptoms in the previous 12 months at age approximately 4 to 6 years. We investigated the association between PUFA exposures and atopic dermatitis using multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for potential confounders. We assessed for effect modification by maternal prenatal smoking, atopic disease history, and child sex. Results: Among 1131 women, 67% were African American and 42% had an atopic disease history; 17% of children had atopic dermatitis. Higher prenatal n-6 PUFAs were associated with increased relative odds of child atopic dermatitis (adjusted odds ratio: 1.25; confidence interval: 1.01-1.54 per interquartile range difference), and interaction models demonstrated that this association was seen in dyads in which the women had a history of atopic disease. Neither prenatal n-3 PUFAs nor n-6:n-3 were associated with child atopic dermatitis.

Recent efforts have been made to significantly improve patient outcomes, specifically with postoperative rehabilitation. Despite the many rehabilitation modalities available, the optimal rehabilitation strategy has yet to be determined. Therefore, this systematic review focuses on evaluating existing postoperative rehabilitation protocols. Specifically, this review analyses the study designs, rehabilitation methods, and outcome measures of postoperative rehabilitation protocols for TKA recipients in the past five years. The PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases were queried for studies evaluating rehabilitation protocols following primary TKA. Of the 11,013 studies identified within the last five years, 70 met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. After assessing for relevance and removing duplicates, a final count of 20 studies remained for analysis. Level-of-evidence was determined by the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) classification system. Our findings demonstrated that continuous passive motion and inpatient rehabilitation may not provide additional benefit to the patient or healthcare system. However, early rehabilitation, telerehabilitation, outpatient therapy, high intensity, and high velocity exercise may be successful forms of rehabilitation. Additionally, weight-bearing biofeedback, neuromuscular electrical stimulation, and balance control appear to be beneficial adjuncts to conventional rehabilitation. Postoperative rehabilitation following TKA facilitates patient recovery and improves quality of life. This systematic review analyzed the existing rehabilitation protocols from the past five years. Some studies did not accurately describe the conventional rehabilitation protocols, the duration of therapy sessions, and the timing of these sessions. As such, future studies should explicitly describe their methodology. This will allow high-quality assessments and the conception of standardized protocols.","Knee replacement is one of the most common types of surgery that people choose to have worldwide. Recently, doctors have tried to make big improvements in outcomes, especially during the rehab process. Even though there are lots of ways to do rehab, doctors have not figured out the best strategy. Because of this, we will focus on rating different rehab strategies that are in published papers. Specifically, we will look at how studies were done, which rehab methods they used, and what the measured outcomes were. We will do this for rehab strategies for people that had knee replacement in the last 5 years. We searched several databases of biomedical literature for studies that looked at rehab strategies after knee replacement. Out of more than 11,000 from our search, 70 met our criteria for including them. After considering relevance and removing duplicates, we were left with 20 studies. We found that Continuous Passive Motion (CPM), where a device moves the leg for the patient, and inpatient rehab may not provide any benefit to the patient or the healthcare system. However, early rehab, tele-rehab, where providers interact with patients remotely using the internet, and outpatient therapy may be successful types of rehab. Exercise at high intensity and high speeds may also be successful types of rehab. One method that seems to help as a supplement is “weight-bearing biofeedback,” where the patient puts some weight on the joint while wearing sensors to ensure it is not too much. Electrical stimulation of the muscles and balancing exercises also appear to be helpful supplements to typical rehab methods. Rehab after knee replacement surgery helps patients recover and improves their quality of life. This article looked at published rehab strategies used in the last 5 years.

The objectives of the systematic review were as follows: To determine the effectiveness of inpatient physiotherapy after discharge from an acute care hospital compared with outpatient physiotherapy delivered in either a clinic-based or home-based setting for primary total joint replacement patients. To determine the effectiveness of outpatient physiotherapy delivered by a physiotherapist in either a clinic-based or home-based setting in addition to a home exercise program compared with a home exercise program alone for primary total joint replacement patients.

Conclusions: Based on the evidence, the Medical Advisory Secretariat reached the following conclusions with respect to physiotherapy rehabilitation and physical functioning 1 year after primary TKR or THR surgery: There is high-quality evidence from 1 large RCT to support the use of home-based physiotherapy instead of inpatient physiotherapy after primary THR or TKR surgery. There is low-to-moderate quality evidence from 1 large RCT to support the conclusion that receiving a monitoring phone call from a physiotherapist and practicing home exercises is comparable to receiving clinic-based physiotherapy and practicing home exercises for people who have had primary TKR surgery. However, results may not be generalizable to those who have had THR surgery. There is moderate evidence to suggest that an exercise program beginning 4 to 6 weeks before primary TKR surgery is not effective.","The goal of this health technology policy analysis was to figure out, where, how, and when physiotherapy (PT) can best help patients after knee or hip replacement. We also hope to figure out the financial impact of the best PT strategies for Ontario. Specifically, we wanted to figure out how inpatient PT (during a stay at a care facility) compared with outpatient PT, either at a clinic or at home, for patients that had joint replacements. We also wanted to see how effective outpatient PT with a therapist was, either at a clinic or at home, compared with just a home exercise program for patients that had joint replacements. Finally, we aimed to figure out how effective it is to exercise before surgery for people who are scheduled for knee or hip replacement. Based on the evidence, the Medical Advisory Secretariat concluded that there is good evidence to support using home-based PT instead of inpatient PT after hip or knee replacement. This was concluded with regard to function a year after the surgery. There is some evidence from one large study that getting phone call from a physiotherapist and practicing home exercises is comparable to having PT at a clinic and practicing home exercises for people who have had knee replacement. However, the same might not apply to those who have hip replacement. There is decent evidence that an exercise program beginning 4 to 6 weeks before knee replacement surgery is not effective.",2,C
67,29548061,"This study evaluated the use of telerehabilitation during the postoperative period for patients who underwent total knee arthroplasty (TKA) or unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA). Specifically, this study evaluated the following: (1) patient compliance and adherence to the program, (2) time spent performing physical therapy exercises, (3) the usability of the virtual rehabilitation platform, and (4) clinical outcome scores in a selected primary knee arthroplasty cohort. A total of 157 consecutive patients underwent TKA (n = 18) or UKA (n = 139). These patients used a telerehabilitation system with an instructional avatar, three-dimensional motion measurement and analysis software, and real-time televisit capability designed for arthroplasty patients. Compliance was determined by how many times the patients followed prescribed repetitions of exercises. The total time spent performing exercises for each patient was collected. The usability of the virtual rehabilitation platform (on the patient's end) was evaluated using the system usability scale (SUS) questionnaire. The number of in-person and televisits was recorded for each patient. Patient-reported outcomes were collected through the patient and clinician interfaces and included the Knee Society Score (KSS) for pain and functions, the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) score, and Boston University Activity Measure for Post-Acute Care (AM-PAC) score. Patients spent an average of 29.5 days partaking in the therapy. TKA and UKA patients had a mean of 3.5 and 3.2 outpatient follow-up visits, each, for in-office therapy with a physical therapist, respectively. This figure exceeded the mean number of real-time virtual patient-clinician visits by 0.8 visits per patient in the TKA cohort and by 1 visit per patient in the UKA cohort. Patients spent on average 26.5 minutes per day conducting an average of 13.5 exercises. By the end of rehabilitation, patients had spent an average of 10.8 hours performing exercises, and of all the exercises performed, approximately 21 exercises were uniquely designed. Mean SUS score in the cohort was 93 points, which was interpreted as being above the 50th percentile point of the scale. Following therapy, KSS pain and function scores improved markedly and the improvements were measured at 368% for TKA and 350% for UKA (pain) and 27% for UKA and 33% for TKA (function). In addition, WOMAC scores improved by 57% and 66% for UKA and TKA patients while the improvement in AM-PAC scores was at 22% and 24%. This telerehabilitation platform encouraged clinician-patient interaction beyond the hospital setting and offers the advantage of cost savings, convenience, at-home monitoring, and coordination of care, all of which are geared to improve adherence and overall patient satisfaction. Additionally, the biometric data can be used to develop custom physical therapy regimens to assure proper rehabilitation, which is lacking in other telerehabilitation applications that use noninteractive videos that can be watched on mobile devices and tablets.","This study looked at using tele-rehab (where providers interact with patients remotely using the internet) after complete or partial knee replacement surgery. Specifically, the study looked at: (1) how well patients kept up with the program, (2) time spent performing physical therapy exercises, (3) how easy it was to use the virtual rehab software, and (4) outcomes for a certain group of patients that had knee replacement surgery. A total of 157 patients in a row had complete (18) or partial (139) knee replacement. These patients used a tele-rehab system with an instructional avatar, three-dimensional motion measurement and analysis software, and real-time tele-visit capability designed for joint surgery patients. We measured how well patients kept up with the program by how many times the patients followed the recommended repetitions of exercises. We collected the total each patient time spent performing exercises. We evaluated how easy it was for patients to use the virtual rehab software using a questionnaire. We also recorded the number of in-person and virtual visits for each patient. We collected patient-reported outcomes through patient/doctor portals. Measurements included were the Knee Society Score (KSS) for pain and functions, the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) score, and Boston University Activity Measure for Post-Acute Care (AM-PAC) score. Patients spent an average of about 30 days participating in the therapy. Complete knee replacement patients, on average, had 3.5 outpatient follow-up visits each for in-office therapy with a physical therapist. Partial knee replacement patients had, on average, 3.2 of these visits. For complete knee replacement patients, this was on average 0.8 more visits than for real-time virtual patient-clinician. For partial hip replacement patients, it was 1 more visit. Patients spent, on average, 26.5 minutes per day doing an average of 13.5 exercises. By the end of rehab, patients had spent an average of 10.8 hours doing exercises, and of all the exercises performed, around 21 were uniquely designed. After therapy, KSS pain and function scores improved notably. The scores for pain improved by 368% for complete knee replacement and 350% for partial. The scores for function improved by 33% for complete knee replacement 27% for partial. Additionally, WOMAC scores improved by 57% for partial knee replacement and 66% for compete knee replacement. The improvement in AM-PAC scores was at 22% for partial and 24% for complete. This tele-rehab platform encouraged interaction between doctors and patients beyond the hospital setting. It offers the advantage of cost savings, convenience, at-home monitoring, and coordination of care. All of these are geared to improve how well patients keep up and overall patient satisfaction. Additionally, the data from the platform can be used to make custom physical therapy regimens to assure proper rehabilitation. This is lacking in other tele-rehab applications that use non-interactive videos that can be watched on mobile devices and tablets.",2,C
67,34331766,"Physical therapy is routinely delivered to patients after discharge from the hospital following knee arthroplasty. Posthospitalization physical therapy is thought to be beneficial, particularly for those patients most at risk of poor outcome, the subgroup with persistent function-limiting pain, despite an apparently successful surgery. Research teams have undertaken 3 large-scale multicenter Phase 3 randomized clinical trials designed specifically for patients at risk of poor outcome following knee arthroplasty. All 3 trials screened for poor outcome risk using different methods and investigated different physical therapist interventions delivered in different ways. Despite the variety of types of physical therapy and mode of delivery, all trials found no effects of the enhanced treatment compared with usual care. In all cases, usual care required a lower dosage of physical therapy compared with the enhanced interventions. This Perspective compares and contrasts the 3 trials, speculates on factors that could explain the no-effect findings, and proposes areas for future study designed to benefit the poor outcome phenotype.","Physical therapy (PT) is often given to patients that had knee replacement after after leaving the hospital. PT after leaving the hospital is thought to be helpful, especially for patients with high risk of bad outcomes.

Research teams have done 3 large-scale trials across different health care facilities, designed specifically for patients at risk of poor outcome following knee replacement. All 3 trials checked for poor outcome risk using different methods and looked at different ways for physical therapists to try to help. Despite the variety of types of physical therapy and how they were given, all trials found no effects of the enhanced treatment compared with usual care. In all cases, usual care required a lower amount of physical therapy compared with the enhanced interventions. This article expresses our opinions on recent research.

67,30281207,"Objective: Although total knee replacement (TKR) surgery is highly prevalent and generally successful, functional outcomes post-TKR vary widely. Most patients receive some physical therapy (PT) following TKR, but PT practice is variable and associations between specific content and dose of PT interventions and functional outcomes are unknown. Research has identified exercise interventions associated with better outcomes but studies have not assessed whether such evidence has been translated into clinical practice. We characterized the content, dose, and progression of usual post-acute PT services following TKR, and examined associations of specific details of post-acute PT with patients' 6-month functional outcomes. Methods: Post-acute PT data were collected from patients who were undergoing primary unilateral TKR and participating in a clinical trial of a phone-based coaching intervention. PT records from the terminal episode of care were reviewed and utilization and exercise content data were extracted. Descriptive statistics and linear regression models characterized PT treatment factors and identified associations with 6-month outcomes. Results: We analyzed 112 records from 30 PT sites. Content and dose of specific exercises and incidence of progression varied widely. Open chain exercises were utilized more frequently than closed chain (median 21 [interquartile range (IQR) 4-49] versus median 13 [IQR 4-28.5]). Median (IQR) occurrence of progression of closed and open chain exercise was 0 (0-2) and 1 (0-3), respectively. Shorter timed stair climb was associated with greater total number of PT interventions and use and progression of closed chain exercises. Discussion: Data suggest that evidence-based interventions are underutilized and dose may be insufficient to obtain optimal outcomes.","Although knee replacement surgery is very common and usually turns out well, amount of function after varies widely. Most patients have some physical therapy (PT) after knee replacement, but PT practice varies. We don’t know which amounts and kinds of PT are associated with which outcomes. Research has shown that exercise is associated with better outcomes, but studies have not looked at whether this has made its way into clinical practice. We looked at the content, amount, and progression of usual PT services after knee replacement. We also examined associations of specific details of PT after surgery with how much function patients had after 6 months. We collected PT data from patients who were having knee replacement surgery on one side and participating in a clinical trial of a phone-based coaching program. We reviewed PT records from final sessions to find how much patients used the PT and what exercises were done. We used statistical methods to see which parts of PT treatment were associated with 6-month outcomes. In all, we looked at 112 records from 30 PT sites. The types and amounts of exercises, and how they progressed, varied widely. Exercises that used weights or other resistance were use more than body-weight exercises (on average 21 versus 13). Progression of exercises was used on average 0 times for exercises with resistance and 1 time for exercises that just used body weight. Climbing stairs faster was associated with more PT sessions and the use and progression of body-weight exercises. The evidence suggests that treatments backed by studies are not used as much as they should be and the amount of PT may not be enough to create the best possible outcomes.",2,C
67,31427131,"Background: Early ambulation with physical therapy (PT) following total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has demonstrated benefits in the literature. However, the impact of early PT on rehabilitation performance and opioid consumption has not been elucidated. We evaluate the effect of same-day PT on inhospital functional outcomes and opioid consumption. Methods: We retrospectively identified 2 cohorts of primary TKA patients from July 2016 to December 2017: PT0 (n = 295) received PT on the day of surgery, and PT1 (n = 392) received PT on postoperative day (POD) 1. Outcomes studied included number of feet walked on POD0-3, visual analog scale pain scores, morphine equivalents (ME) consumed, length of stay, and discharge disposition. Analysis was conducted using the Student t-test and Fisher exact test. Results: In comparison to the PT1 group, the PT0 group walked significantly more steps on POD1 (347.6 vs 167.4 ft, P < .0001), POD2 (342.1 vs 203.5 ft, P < .0001), and POD3 (190.3 vs 128.9 ft, P = .00028). There was no difference between the 2 groups for visual analog scale. The PT0 group also consumed significantly fewer total ME when compared to the PT1 group (149.0 vs 200.3 mg, P = .0002). The PT0 group had a significantly shorter length of stay when compared to the PT1 group (2.7 vs 3.2 days, P = .00075). More patients were discharged home in the PT0 group (81.7% vs 54.8%, P < .0001). Conclusion: We observed that initiation of PT on POD0 led to better PT performance, reduced ME during hospitalization, and more patients discharged home.","Research has shown that having patients walk early with physical therapy (PT) after knee replacement has benefits. However, the impact of early PT on rehab performance and opioid use is still unclear. We looked at the effect of same-day PT on how well patients functions and opioid use while in the hospital. To do this, we looked at 2 past groups of knee replacement patients from July 2016 to December 2017. The first group had 295 patients and had PT on the day of surgery. The second group had 392 patients and received PT on the day after surgery. The outcomes we looked at included the number of feet walked in the first 3 days after surgery, patient reported pain scores, amount of morphine or similar drugs used, length of stay, and where the patient was sent on discharge. In comparison to the second group (which had PT the day of after surgery), the first group (which had PT the day of the surgery) walked significantly more steps on the first 3 days after surgery. The first group walked, on average, 348 feet the first day after, while the second group walked 167 feet. The second day, the first group walked 342 feet while the second group walked 203. The third day after surgery, the first group walked 190 feet while the second group walked 129 feet. There was no difference between the 2 groups for pain reported. The first group (which had PT the day of the surgery) also used significantly less morphine or similar drugs when compared to the second group (which had PT the day after surgery). The first group also had a significantly shorter length of stay compared to the second group (on average 2.7 days vs 3.2 days). More patients were discharged home in the first group (81.7% vs 54.8%). In conclusion, we observed that starting PT the day of surgery led to better PT performance, reduced drug use during hospitalization, and more patients discharged home.",2,C
67,24172642,"Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is the gold standard treatment for end-stage knee osteoarthritis. Most patients report successful long-term outcomes and reduced pain after TKA, but recovery is variable and the majority of patients continue to demonstrate lower extremity muscle weakness and functional deficits compared to age-matched control subjects. Given the potential positive influence of postoperative rehabilitation and the lack of established standards for prescribing exercise paradigms after TKA, the purpose of this study was to systematically review randomized, controlled studies to determine the effectiveness of postoperative outpatient care on short- and long-term functional recovery. Nineteen studies were identified as highly relevant for the review and four categories of postoperative intervention were discussed: 1) strengthening exercises; 2) aquatic therapy; 3) balance training; and 4) clinical environment. Optimal outpatient physical therapy protocols should include: strengthening and intensive functional exercises given through land-based or aquatic programs, the intensity of which is increased based on patient progress. Due to the highly individualized characteristics of these types of exercises, outpatient physical therapy performed in a clinic under the supervision of a trained physical therapist may provide the best long-term outcomes after the surgery. Supervised or remotely supervised therapy may be effective at reducing some of the impairments following TKA, but several studies without direct oversight produced poor results. Most studies did not accurately describe the ""usual care"" or control groups and information about the dose, frequency, intensity and duration of the rehabilitation protocols were lacking from several studies.","Complete knee replacement surgery is the best known treatment for severe arthritis in the knee. Most patients have successful long-term outcomes and reduced pain after knee replacement. However, recovery varies, and most patients continue to have weakness in the legs and less function compared to peers of the same age. There is a potential positive influence of rehab after surgery and a lack of established standards for prescribing exercise paradigms after knee replacement. With this in mind, our goal in this review article was to look carefully at studies to determine how effective outpatient care is for regaining function short-term and long-term. We found 19 studies that we deemed very relevant for the review. We discussed four categories of treatment after surgery: 1) strengthening exercises; 2) aquatic therapy; 3) balance training; and 4) clinical environment. The best outpatient physical therapy strategies should include strengthening and intensive functional exercises, either normal or in water. The intensity of these should increase based on patient progress. Since these exercises are very individualized, outpatient physical therapy done in a clinic under with a trained physical therapist may provide the best long-term outcomes after the surgery. Supervised or remotely supervised therapy may be effective at reducing some of the impairments following knee replacement, but several studies without direct oversight had poor results. Most studies did not accurately describe what “usual care” was used to compare against the programs they were testing. Information about the amount, frequency, intensity and duration of the rehab protocols was also missing from several studies.",2,C
67,28901118,"Background: Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) alleviates pain, but muscle strength and function is reduced for a long period postoperatively. Aim: To investigate whether maximal strength training (MST) is more effective in improving muscle strength than standard rehabilitation (SR) after TKA. Design: A randomized, controlled study. Setting: Community physical therapy centers and University hospital research department. Population: Forty-one adults <75 years with primary, unilateral osteoarthritis of the knee scheduled for TKA. Methods: Participants were randomized to supervised MST of the lower extremities 3 times/week for 8 weeks and physiotherapy session1/week (N.=21) or to SR, including physiotherapy sessions/telephone contact 1/week and writing home exercise logs (N.=20). Maximal strength in leg press and knee extension, 6-minute walk test, patient-reported functional outcome score and pain were assessed preoperatively, 7 days, 10 weeks and 12 months postoperatively. Results: The MST group exceeded preoperative levels of muscle strength in leg press and knee extension by 37% and 43%, respectively at 10 weeks' follow-up, and the increase was higher than in the SR group (P≤0.001). Strength differences persisted up to 12-months follow-up. At 12 months, both groups recovered to normative levels in the 6-Minute Walk Test, with no statistically significantly difference between the groups. Conclusions: Participants undergoing MST experienced superior increases in leg press and knee extension muscle strength compared with those managed with SR from 7-day to 10-week follow-up. The difference in muscle strength was maintained at 12-month follow-up. No differences in functional performance were found at any time-point. Clinical rehabilitation impact: Exercises after TKA should be performed with high intensity and target the operated leg specifically.","Complete knee replacement surgery alleviates pain, but muscle strength and function is reduced for a long period after the operation. Our aim was to investigate whether Maximal Strength Training (MST) is more effective in improving muscle strength than standard rehab knee replacement. This study involved two groups who randomly got either the standard care or the experimental care. It was done in community physical therapy centers and a university hospital research department. The study included 41 adults under 75 with arthritis in one knee and who were scheduled for knee replacement surgery. Participants randomly got either supervised MST for the legs 3 times a week for 8 weeks and one physiotherapy session per week or the standard rehab, including physiotherapy sessions and/or telephone contact once a week and writing home exercise logs. The MST group had 21 patients, while the standard rehab group had 20 patients. We measured maximum strength in leg press and knee extension, 6-minute walk test, patient-reported functional outcome score and pain. We looked at these 7 days after the operation, 10 weeks after, and 12 months after. The MST group had 37% more strength in leg press and 43% more strength in knee extension at 10 weeks. These increases were higher than for the group that had standard rehab. Strength differences continued up to the 12-month follow-ups. At 12 months, both groups recovered to normal levels in the 6-Minute Walk Test, with no significant difference between the groups. In conclusion, participants getting Maximal Strength Training (MST) had better increases in leg press and knee extension muscle strength compared to those who had standard rehab, as measured at 7-day to 10-week follow-ups after surgery. The difference in muscle strength was maintained at 12-month follow-up. No differences in functional performance were found at any point. The impact of this on clinical rehab is that exercises after knee replacement should be done with high intensity and should target the operated leg specifically.",2,C
67,25886975,"Background: Rehabilitation, with an emphasis on physiotherapy and exercise, is widely promoted after total knee replacement. However, provision of services varies in content and duration. The aim of this study is to update the review of Minns Lowe and colleagues 2007 using systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of post-discharge physiotherapy exercise in patients with primary total knee replacement. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycInfo, CINAHL and Cochrane CENTRAL to October 4(th) 2013 for randomised evaluations of physiotherapy exercise in adults with recent primary knee replacement. Outcomes were: patient-reported pain and function, knee range of motion, and functional performance. Authors were contacted for missing data and outcomes. Risk of bias and heterogeneity were assessed. Data was combined using random effects meta-analysis and reported as standardised mean differences (SMD) or mean differences (MD). Results: Searches identified 18 randomised trials including 1,739 patients with total knee replacement. Interventions compared: physiotherapy exercise and no provision; home and outpatient provision; pool and gym-based provision; walking skills and more general physiotherapy; and general physiotherapy exercise with and without additional balance exercises or ergometer cycling. Compared with controls receiving minimal physiotherapy, patients receiving physiotherapy exercise had improved physical function at 3-4 months, SMD -0.37 (95% CI -0.62, -0.12), and pain, SMD -0.45 (95% CI -0.85, -0.06). Benefit up to 6 months was apparent when considering only higher quality studies. There were no differences for outpatient physiotherapy exercise compared with home-based provision in physical function or pain outcomes. There was a short-term benefit favouring home-based physiotherapy exercise for range of motion flexion. There were no differences in outcomes when the comparator was hydrotherapy, or when additional balancing or cycling components were included. In one study, a walking skills intervention was associated with a long-term improvement in walking performance. However, for all these evaluations studies were under-powered individually and in combination. Conclusion: After recent primary total knee replacement, interventions including physiotherapy and exercise show short-term improvements in physical function. However this conclusion is based on meta-analysis of a few small studies and no long-term benefits of physiotherapy exercise interventions were identified. Future research should target improvements to long-term function, pain and performance outcomes in appropriately powered trials.","Rehab, with an emphasis on physiotherapy and exercise, is widely promoted after total knee replacement. However, how services are given varies in content and duration.

We searched several medical literature databases, up to October 4th, 2013, for studies of PT exercise in adults that had knee replacements. The outcomes we looked at were: patient-reported pain and function, knee range of motion, and functional performance. We contacted the researchers for missing data and outcomes. We also looked at whether the study results could be misleading. Our searches found 18 studies including 1,739 patients with total knee replacement. The treatments that were compared were: PT exercise without care; home and outpatient care; pool and gym-based care; walking skills and more general PT; and general PT exercise with and without additional balance exercises or a stationary bike. Compared with people with little or no PT, patients that got PT exercise had improved physical function at 3-4 months.

67,27401004,"Purpose: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of non-supervised home-based exercise versus individualized and supervised programs delivered in clinic-based settings for the functional recovery immediately after discharge from a primary TKA. Methods: Medline, Embase, Cochrane, and PEDro databases were screened, from inception to April 2015, in search for randomized clinical trials (RCT) of home-based exercise interventions versus individualized and supervised outpatient physical therapy after primary TKA. Target outcomes were: knee range of motion (ROM), patient-reported pain and function, functional performance, and safety. Risk of bias was assessed with the PEDro scale. After assessing homogeneity, data were combined using random effects meta-analysis and reported as standardized mean differences or mean differences. We set a non-inferiority margin of four points in mean differences. Results: The search and selection process identified 11 RCT of moderate quality and small sample sizes. ROM active extension data suitable for meta-analysis was available from seven studies with 707 patients, and ROM active flexion from nine studies with 983 patients. Most studies showed no difference between groups. Pooled differences were within the non-inferiority margin. Most meta-analyses showed significant statistical heterogeneity. Conclusion: Short-term improvements in physical function and knee ROM do not clearly differ between outpatient physiotherapy and home-based exercise regimes in patients after primary TKA; however, this conclusion is based on a meta-analysis with high heterogeneity.","The aim of this study was to see how effective and safe different functional recovery strategies were immediately after discharge from knee replacement surgery. It compared non-supervised, home-based exercise to individualized and supervised programs delivered in clinic-based settings. We searched several medical literature databases for papers published up until April 2015. We were looking for clinical trials of home-based exercise programs versus individualized and supervised outpatient physical therapy (PT) after knee replacement. The outcomes we compared were knee range of motion (ROM), patient-reported pain and function, functional performance, and safety.  Our search and selection process found 11 clinical trials of decent quality but that looked at small numbers of patients. Seven studies, with a total of 707 patients, had data on ROM for extending the leg that could be used. Nine studies, with a total of 983 patients, had data on ROM for bending the leg. Most studies showed no difference between groups. Even taken altogether, differences between the treatment types were small enough to be by chance. In conclusion, short-term improvements in physical function and knee ROM are not clearly different between outpatient PT and home-based exercise regimes in patients after knee replacement. However, this conclusion is based on combining studies with many differences.",2,C
69,25422150,"Nearly 20% of mothers will experience an episode of major or minor depression within the first 3 months postpartum, making it the most common complication of childbearing. Postpartum depression (PPD) is significantly undertreated, and because prospective mothers are especially motivated for self-care, a focus on the prevention of PPD holds promise of clinical efficacy. This study is a qualitative review of existing approaches to prevent PPD. A PubMed search identified studies of methods of PPD prevention. The search was limited to peer-reviewed, published, English-language, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of biological, psychological, and psychosocial interventions. Eighty articles were initially identified, and 45 were found to meet inclusion criteria. Eight RCTs of biological interventions were identified and 37 RCTs of psychological or psychosocial interventions. Results were mixed, with 20 studies showing clear positive effects of an intervention and 25 showing no effect. Studies differed widely in screening, population, measurement, and intervention. Among biological studies, anti-depressants and nutrients provided the most evidence of successful intervention. Among psychological and psychosocial studies, 13/17 successful trials targeted an at-risk population, and 4/7 trials using interpersonal therapy demonstrated success of the intervention versus control, with a further two small studies showing trends toward statistical significance. Existing approaches to the prevention of PPD vary widely, and given the current literature, it is not possible to identify one approach that is superior to others. Interpersonal therapy trials and trials that targeted an at-risk population appear to hold the most promise for further study.","Nearly 20% of mothers will experience an episode of major or minor depression within the first 3 months after childbirth (postpartum depression).

A search of articles written about ways to prevent PPD was done using the PubMed search engine. The search only included published articles, written in English, that were evaluated by experts in the same field as the authors. These articles were on studies about the psychology, biology (bodily function), and social aspects of PPD. This search found 88 studies. Only 45 of them met the rules to be included in this research. Of the 45 studies that were included, 8 studies were about biological treatments, and 37 were about psychological or social treatments. Of these 45 studies, 20 studies showed good effects from the treatment and 25 studies showed no effect from the treatment. The studies were very different in how they recognized and treated PPD. There were also differences in the people studied and how the findings were measured. Anti-depressants and nutrients showed the best proof of treatment success in the biological studies. Of the psychological and psychosocial studies, 13 out of 17 successful studies focused on mothers at risk for PPD. Interpersonal therapy showed success in 4 out of 7 studies. Two small studies showed a tendency toward success also. Currently,there are many different ways to prevent PPD. Researchers cannot pinpoint one approach that is better than others.

69,30116896,"Postpartum depression (PPD) is a major public health problem affecting 10-57% of adolescent mothers which can affect not only adolescent mothers but also their infants. Thus, there is a need for interventions to prevent PPD in adolescent mothers. However, recent systematic reviews have been focused on effective interventions to prevent PPD in adult mothers. These interventions may not necessarily be applicable for adolescent mothers. Therefore, the purpose of this review was to examine the effectiveness of the existing interventions to prevent PPD in adolescent mothers. A systematic search was performed in MEDLINE, CINAHL, and SCOPUS databases between January 2000 and March 2017 with English language and studies involving human subjects. Studies reporting on the outcomes of intervention to prevent PPD particularly in adolescent mothers were selected. Non-comparative studies were excluded. From 2002 identified records, 13 studies were included, reporting on 2236 adolescent pregnant women. The evidence from this systematic review suggests that 6 of 13 studies from both psychological and psychosocial interventions including (1) home-visiting intervention, (2) prenatal antenatal and postnatal educational program, (3) CBT psycho-educational, (4) the REACH program based on interpersonal therapy, and (5) infant massage training is successful in reducing rates of PPD symptoms in adolescent mothers in the intervention group than those mothers in the control group. These interventions might be considered for incorporation in antenatal care interventions for adolescent pregnant women. However, this review did not find evidence identifying the most effective intervention for preventing postpartum depression symptoms in adolescent mothers.","Depression after giving birth, postpartum depression (PPD) is a major public health problem. PPD affects 10-57% of adolescent mothers. It can affect not only adolescent mothers but also their infants. There is a need for treatments to prevent PPD in adolescent mothers. Recent thorough reviews of studies on preventing PPD have been focused on successful treatments in adult mothers. These treatments to prevent PPD may not necessarily apply to adolescent mothers. This research judged the benefit of accepted treatments to prevent PPD in adolescent mothers. A thorough search was performed in MEDLINE, CINAHL, and SCOPUS databases (organized collection of articles including health topics) to find English language articles written between January 2000 and March 2017 on studies involving human subjects. Studies reporting on the outcomes of intervention (treatment) to prevent PPD particularly in adolescent mothers were selected. Researchers did not include studies that were not comparative studies. Of the 2002 articles found, researchers included 13 studies. These 13 studies included information on a total of 2236 adolescent pregnant women. Six out of 13 studies suggests interventions are successful in lowering rates of PPD symptoms in adolescent mothers (compared to the group that did not receive interventions). The research was from the psychological and social intervention studies. The interventions included: home visits; education (before, during, and after pregnancy and childbirth); psychological therapy; interpersonal therapy, and infant massage training. These interventions might be included in maternity care for adolescent pregnant women. This research did not find out the most successful intervention to prevent postpartum depression in adolescent mothers.",2,C
69,26231973,"Most interventions to prevent postpartum depression (PPD) focus on the mother rather than the mother-infant dyad. As strong relationships between infant sleep and cry behavior and maternal postpartum mood have been demonstrated by previous research, interventions targeted at the dyad may reduce symptoms of PPD. The goal of the current study was to examine the effectiveness of Practical Resources for Effective Postpartum Parenting (PREPP). PREPP is a new PPD prevention protocol that aims to treat women at risk for PPD by promoting maternally mediated behavioral changes in their infants, while also including mother-focused skills. Results of this randomized control trial (RCT) (n = 54) indicate that this novel, brief intervention was well tolerated and effective in reducing maternal symptoms of anxiety and depression, particularly at 6 weeks postpartum. Additionally, this study found that infants of mothers enrolled in PREPP had fewer bouts of fussing and crying at 6 weeks postpartum than those infants whose mothers were in the Enhanced TAU group. These preliminary results indicate that PREPP has the potential to reduce the incidence of PPD in women at risk and to directly impact the developing mother-child relationship, the mother's view of her child, and child outcomes.","Most treatments to prevent depression after giving birth, postpartum depression (PPD), focus on the mother instead of the total relationship between mother and infant.

69,29908406,"Objective: Postpartum mood disorders represent a serious problem affecting 10-20% of women and support groups offer a promising intervention modality. The current study examined participant satisfaction with and effectiveness of a peer-facilitated postpartum support group. Intervention: The program consists of a free, peer-support group, developed to increase social support and destigmatise postpartum mood symptoms. The weekly group is co-facilitated by former group attendees and maternal health professionals. Setting: The peer-support program is offered in an urban city in the southeastern United States. Design: To address study aims, a community-based participatory research approach was implemented. Participant satisfaction was assessed via mixed methods analyses. Differences in depression scores at follow-up between program attendees and a community sample were examined via weighted linear regression analysis following propensity score analysis. Finally, within-group change in depression scores for program attendees was examined using a repeated measures ANOVA. Participants: Intake program data were provided by the sponsoring organisation (n = 73) and follow-up data were collected via an online survey from program attendees (n = 45). A community sample was recruited to establish a comparison group (n = 152). Measurements and findings: Participant satisfaction was high with overwhelmingly positive perceptions of the program. Postparticipation depression scores were similar to those of the community sample at follow-up (p = .447). Among attendees, pre-post analyses revealed reductions in depression symptoms with significant interactions for time × complications (p ≤ .001) and time × delivery method (p ≤ .017). Key conclusions: Overall, findings indicate this peer-support program is not only acceptable to program attendees but also they provide a potential mechanism for improving mental health outcomes; however, further evaluation is needed. Findings also emphasise the importance of integrating evaluation procedures into community-based mental health programming to support effectiveness.

69,28619476,"Background: Post-partum depression is a serious mood disorder in women that might be triggered by peripartum fluctuations in reproductive hormones. This phase 2 study investigated brexanolone (USAN; formerly SAGE-547 injection), an intravenous formulation of allopregnanolone, a positive allosteric modulator of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) receptors, for the treatment of post-partum depression. Methods: For this double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial, we enrolled self-referred or physician-referred female inpatients (≤6 months post partum) with severe post-partum depression (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression [HAM-D] total score ≥26) in four hospitals in the USA. Eligible women were randomly assigned (1:1), via a computer-generated randomisation program, to receive either a single, continuous intravenous dose of brexanolone or placebo for 60 h. Patients and investigators were masked to treatment assignments. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in the 17-item HAM-D total score at 60 h, assessed in all randomised patients who started infusion of study drug or placebo and who had a completed baseline HAM-D assessment and at least one post-baseline HAM-D assessment. Patients were followed up until day 30. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02614547. Findings: This trial was done between Dec 15, 2015 (first enrolment), and May 19, 2016 (final visit of the last enrolled patient). 21 women were randomly assigned to the brexanolone (n=10) and placebo (n=11) groups. At 60 h, mean reduction in HAM-D total score from baseline was 21·0 points (SE 2·9) in the brexanolone group compared with 8·8 points (SE 2·8) in the placebo group (difference -12·2, 95% CI -20·77 to -3·67; p=0·0075; effect size 1·2). No deaths, serious adverse events, or discontinuations because of adverse events were reported in either group. Four of ten patients in the brexanolone group had adverse events compared with eight of 11 in the placebo group. The most frequently reported adverse events in the brexanolone group were dizziness (two patients in the brexanolone group vs three patients in the placebo group) and somnolence (two vs none). Moderate treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in two patients in the brexanolone group (sinus tachycardia, n=1; somnolence, n=1) and in two patients in the placebo group (infusion site pain, n=1; tension headache, n=1); one patient in the placebo group had a severe treatment-emergent adverse event (insomnia). Interpretation: In women with severe post-partum depression, infusion of brexanolone resulted in a significant and clinically meaningful reduction in HAM-D total score, compared with placebo. Our results support the rationale for targeting synaptic and extrasynaptic GABAA receptors in the development of therapies for patients with post-partum depression. A pivotal clinical programme for the investigation of brexanolone in patients with post-partum depression is in progress.","Post-partum depression (depression after childbirth) is a serious mood disorder in women that might be triggered by changes in reproductive hormones during the period of time around pregnancy. This research study examined the drug, brexanolone (formerly SAGE-547 injection). Brexanolone is a naturally occurring reproductive steroid hormone that affects receptors in the brain and nervous system. It is used as an IV medicine for the treatment of post-partum depression. Researchers studied female inpatients who gave birth within 6 months of the study with severe post-partum depression (in four hospitals in the USA. The severity of depression was checked by the questionnaire-Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression [HAM-D]. Eligible women received either one, continuous IV dose of brexanolone for 60 hours or a placebo (a procedure that appears like the real treatment but has no treatment value). The women were chosen at random by a computer program to receive the real treatment or the placebo. Both patients and researchers did not know who received the real treatment and who received the placebo.

This trial was done between Dec 15, 2015 (first enrolment), and May 19, 2016 (final visit of the last enrolled patient). 21 women were randomly assigned to the brexanolone (10 women) and placebo (11 women) groups. At 60 hours, the average decrease in the depression score by the HAM-D questionnaire was 21 points in the brexanolone group (compared to the score at the start of the study). In the placebo group, the HAM-D score only decreased by an average of 8.8 points. No deaths, serious adverse (harmful) events, or stopping of the procedures because of adverse events were reported in either group. Four of ten patients in the brexanolone group had adverse events compared with eight of 11 in the placebo group. The most frequently reported adverse events in the brexanolone group were dizziness (two patients in the brexanolone group vs three patients in the placebo group) and sleepiness (two vs none). Other adverse events reported in two patients in the brexanolone group were fast heart rate and sleepiness. Two patients in the placebo group had adverse events; pain at the IV site and tension headache. One patient in the placebo group had a severe treatment adverse event (insomnia). In women with severe post-partum depression, brexanolone IV resulted in a significant and clinically meaningful reduction in HAM-D total score of depression, compared with placebo.

69,25586754,"Objectives: Both antidepressant medications and psychological therapy are common treatments for depression in postpartum women. Antidepressant treatment may have a number of practical disadvantages, including a preference by women to avoid medication while breastfeeding. Consequently, more information about the relative benefits of the two modalities in the perinatal period is helpful. In the treatment of depressive disorders there is some evidence that combination therapies (pharmacological plus psychological treatment) may be more efficacious than either form of mono-therapy in isolation. However, in the treatment of postnatal depression, such evidence is limited. Method: Forty five postpartum women with a DSM-IV diagnosis of depression were randomised to receive either: 1) cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT); 2) sertraline, or 3) a combination of both treatment modalities. Psychometric measures were collected weekly for 12 weeks, with a follow-up at 24 weeks. Results: Symptoms of depression and anxiety were reduced to a significant degree following all three treatments. CBT mono-therapy was found to be superior to both sertraline mono-therapy and combination therapy after 12 weeks. The CBT mono-therapy group appeared to display the most rapid initial gains after treatment commencement. Conclusions: In this sample, a specialised CBT program for postnatal depression was found to be superior as a mono-therapy compared to sertraline, a commonly prescribed SSRI antidepressant. This is in contrast to previous studies which have found no detectable difference in the efficacies of drug and psychological treatment for postnatal depression. Unlike some previous work, this study allowed a statistically independent evaluation of CBT mono-therapy for postnatal depression compared to both antidepressant and combination therapy. In line with previous studies in postpartum women, there was no detectable advantage of combining pharmacological and psychological treatments in the short term.","Both antidepressant medications and psychological therapy are common treatments for depression in women after childbirth (postpartum depression-PPD).

70,29261855,"Vitamin B6 is one of the central molecules in the cells of living organisms. Water-soluble vitamin B6 is widely present in many foods, including meat, fish, nuts, beans, grains, fruits, and vegetables. Additionally, B6 is present in many multivitamin preparations for adults and children and is added as a supplement to foods, power bars, and powders. There are several active compounds or vitamers which fall under the generic B6. These include pyridoxine alcohol, pyridoxal an aldehyde, pyridoxamine, which differs from the first two with an amine group, and a 2,5' phosphate esters. The major esters are the active coenzyme form and are pyridoxal 5'phosphate (PLP) and pyridoxamine 5'phosphate (PMP). The primary form of B6 in meats are the esters, and the dominant plant source is pyridoxine, which is less bioavailable. Pyridoxine is the most common form found in multivitamins.

Nevertheless, a subclinical, undiagnosed deficiency may be present in some subjects, particularly in the elderly. Objective: This review gives a complete overview over the metabolism and interactions of vitamin B6. Further, we show which complications and deficiency symptoms can occur due to a lack of vitamin B6 and possibilities for public health and supplemental interventions. Methods: The database Medline (www.ncvi.nlm.nih.gov) was searched for terms like ""vitamin B6"", ""pyridoxal"", ""cancer"", ""homocysteine"", etc. For a complete understanding, we included studies with early findings from the forties as well as recent results from 2006. These studies were summarised and compared in different chapters. Results and conclusion: In fact, it has been proposed that suboptimal vitamin B6 status is associated with certain diseases that particularly afflict the elderly population: impaired cognitive function, Alzheimer's disease, cardiovascular disease, and different types of cancer. Some of these problems may be related to the elevated homocysteine concentrations associated to vitamin B6 deficiency, but there is also evidence for other mechanisms independent of homocysteine by which a suboptimal vitamin B6 status could increase the risk for these chronic diseases.","Vitamin B6 is thought to be a most versatile chemical that participates in more than 100 biochemical reactions in the body.

70,11813080,"The vitamins folic acid, B12 and B6 and B2 are the source of coenzymes which participate in one carbon metabolism. In this metabolism, a carbon unit from serine or glycine is transferred to tetrahydrofolate (THF) to form methylene-THF. This is either used as such for the synthesis of thymidine, which is incorporated into DNA, oxidized to formyl-THF which is used for the synthesis of purines, which are building blocks of RNA and DNA, or it is reduced to methyl-THF which used to methylate homocysteine to form methionine, a reaction which is catalyzed by a B12-containing methyltransferase. Much of the methionine which is formed is converted to S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), a universal donor of methyl groups, including DNA, RNA, hormones, neurotransmitters, membrane lipids, proteins and others. Because of these functions, interest in recent years has been growing particularly in the area of aging and the possibility that certain diseases that afflict the aging population, loss of cognitive function, Alzheimer's disease, cardiovascular disease, cancer and others, may be in part explained by inadequate intake or inadequate status of these vitamins. Homocysteine, a product of methionine metabolism as well as a precursor of methionine synthesis, was shown recently to be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, stroke and thrombosis when its concentration in plasma is slightly elevated. There are now data which show association between elevated plasma homocysteine levels and loss of neurocognitive function and Alzheimer's disease. These associations could be due to a neurotoxic effect of homocysteine or to decreased availability of SAM which results in hypomethylation in the brain tissue. Hypomethylation is also thought to exacerbate depressive tendency in people, and for (colorectal) cancer DNA hypomethylation is thought to be the link between the observed relationship between inadequate folate status and cancer. There are many factors that contribute to the fact that the status of these vitamins in the elderly is inadequate. These factors are in part physiological such as the achlorhydria which affects vitamin B12 absorption and in part socioeconomic and habitual. We need more studies to confirm that these vitamins have important functions in the etiology of these diseases. We also need to establish if these diseases can be prevented or diminished by proper nutrition starting at a younger age.","There are several B vitamins: folic acid, B12 and B6 and B2. They are important in one carbon metabolism of protein and DNA metabolism. Here, one carbon unit is transferred from an amino acid (building blocks of proteins) by a B vitamin, tetrahydrofolate (THF), to form a new chemical, methylene-THF. Methylene-THF is used in the synthesis of DNA, RNA, or in the metabolism of important amino acids (such as the reaction that changes one amino acid, homocysteine, to another amino acid, methionine). Much of the methionine which is formed is made into S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and then used in the metabolism of DNA, RNA, hormones, neurotransmitters (nerve impulse chemicals), cell lipids (fats), proteins and others. Because of these functions, interest in recent years has been growing particularly in the area of aging. The possibility that certain diseases associated with aging such as the loss of thinking, Alzheimer's disease, cardiovascular disease, cancer and others, may be in part explained by inadequate intake or inadequate amounts in the body of these vitamins. Homocysteine, an amino acid that is both needed to make methionine as well as made from methionine metabolism was shown recently to be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, stroke and blood clots when its amount in blood is slightly elevated. Facts now show association between increased blood levels of homocysteine and loss of brain function and Alzheimer's disease. These associations could be due to harmful effects of homocysteine on the nervous system or on the decreased amount of SAM in the brain. Problems with methionine metabolism are also thought to increase depressive tendency in people.These problems with methionine and DNA metabolism are also thought to be the link between the relationship seen between low levels of vitamin B folate and colorectal cancer. Many factors(reasons) contribute to the fact that the amount of these vitamins in the elderly is inadequate. One factor is not having enough acid in the stomach (achlorhydria). This decreases the amount of vitamin B12 your stomach can absorb from food. Other factors include socioeconomic and habits. We need more studies to prove that these vitamins have important functions in the causes of these diseases. We also need to prove iif these diseases can be prevented or lessened by proper nutrition starting at a younger age.",2,B
70,28367454,"The immune system is critical in preventing infection and cancer, and malnutrition can weaken different aspects of the immune system to undermine immunity. Previous studies suggested that vitamin B6 deficiency could decrease serum antibody production with concomitant increase in IL4 expression. However, evidence on whether vitamin B6 deficiency would impair immune cell differentiation, cytokines secretion, and signal molecule expression involved in JAK/STAT signaling pathway to regulate immune response remains largely unknown. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of vitamin B6 deficiency on the immune system through analysis of T lymphocyte differentiation, IL-2, IL-4, and INF-Î³ secretion, and SOCS-1 and T-bet gene transcription. We generated a vitamin B6-deficient mouse model via vitamin B6-depletion diet. The results showed that vitamin B6 deficiency retards growth, inhibits lymphocyte proliferation, and interferes with its differentiation. After ConA stimulation, vitamin B6 deficiency led to decrease in IL-2 and increase in IL-4 but had no influence on IFN-Î³. Real-time PCR analysis showed that vitamin B6 deficiency downregulated T-bet and upregulated SOCS-1 transcription. Meanwhile, the appropriate supplement of vitamin B6 could benefit immunity of the organism.","The immune system is critical in preventing infection and cancer, and malnutrition can weaken different aspects of the immune system to decrease immunity.

Researchers study the effects of vitamin B6 deficiency on the immune system by studying T lymphocyte (type of white blood cell) function, the secretion of immune chemicals, and the function of certain genes. We made a vitamin B6-deficient mouse model by supplying a diet without enough vitamin B6. The results showed that vitamin B6 deficiency slows down growth and inhibits lymphocyte cell production and functions. When T lymphocytes were activated, vitamin B6 deficiency influenced the secretion of some immune chemicals. This study showed that vitamin B6 deficiency affected the function of certain genes.

70,8302491,"Animal and human studies suggest that vitamin B6 deficiency affects both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. Lymphocyte differentiation and maturation are altered by deficiency, delayed-type hypersensitivity responses are reduced, and antibody production may be indirectly impaired. Although repletion of the vitamin restores these functions, megadoses do not produce benefits beyond those observed with moderate supplementation. Additional human studies indicate that vitamin B6 status may influence tumor growth and disease processes. Deficiency of the vitamin has been associated with immunological changes observed in the elderly, persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and those with uremia or rheumatoid arthritis. Future research efforts should focus on establishing the mechanism underlying the effects of vitamin B6 on immunity and should attempt to establish safe intake levels that optimize immune response.","Animal and human research studies suggest that vitamin B6 deficiency (not enough vitamin B6) affects the immune system. White blood cell function and antibody production are damaged. Delayed allergy reactions are reduced (like the reaction to a tuberculosis (TB) skin test)). Taking enough vitamin B6 to get levels back to normal corrects the immune system problems. Taking very high doses supplements does not cause further improvement. Human research also show that the amount of vitamin B6 in the body may affect tumor growth and disease. Vitamin B6 deficiency (not enough vitamin B6 in the body) has been associated with immune system changes in the elderly.Vitamin B6 deficiency also affects people with HIV infections, kidney disease, and rheumatoid arthritis. Future research studies should focus on explaining exactly how vitamin B6 affects the immune system and the right amount of vitamin B6 to take for the best immune system function.",2,B
70,33941768,"We have reported that a subpopulation of patients with schizophrenia have lower levels of vitamin B6 (VB6) in peripheral blood than do healthy controls. In a previous study, we found that VB6 level was inversely proportional to the patient's positive and negative symptom scale (PANSS) score for measuring symptom severity, suggesting that the loss of VB6 might contribute to the development of schizophrenia symptoms. In the present study, to clarify the relationship between VB6 deficiency and schizophrenia, we generated VB6-deficient (VB6(-)) mice through feeding with a VB6-lacking diet as a mouse model for the subpopulation of schizophrenia patients with VB6 deficiency. After feeding for 4 weeks, plasma VB6 level in VB6(-) mice decreased to 3% of that in control mice. The VB6(-) mice showed social deficits and cognitive impairment. Furthermore, the VB6(-) mice showed a marked increase in 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) in the brain, suggesting enhanced noradrenaline (NA) metabolism in VB6(-) mice. We confirmed the increased NA release in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the striatum (STR) of VB6(-) mice through in vivo microdialysis. Moreover, inhibiting the excessive NA release by treatment with VB6 supplementation into the brain and Î±2A adrenoreceptor agonist guanfacine (GFC) suppressed the increased NA metabolism and ameliorated the behavioral deficits. These findings suggest that the behavioral deficits shown in VB6(-) mice are caused by enhancement of the noradrenergic (NAergic) system.","Research has shown that some patients with schizophrenia have lower levels of vitamin B6 in the blood than healthy people. A study showed that lower vitamin B6 levels increased symptoms of schizophrenia. Higher vitamin B6 levels decreased symptoms of schizophrenia.When measuring the symptoms of schizophrenia, the loss of vitamin B6 might help cause the symptom of schizophrenia. To study the relationship between vitamin B6 and schizophrenia, research was done on mice fed a diet without vitamin B6 . This made a mouse model of vitamin B6 deficiency. After 4 weeks of that diet, blood levels of vitamin B6 in these mice decreased to 3% of the healthy mice. The vitamin B6 deficiency mice showed social and thinking (behavior) problems. Also in the vitamin B6 deficiency mouse model, mice showed a high increase in a chemical that suggests increased metabolism of a hormone (noradrenaline (NA)) for flight-or-flight in the brain. We proved that certain parts of the brain released this increased NA in vitamin B6 deficiency mice. Feeding the mice vitamin B6 supplements decreases the excess NA released by the brain. Treating the mice with a specific drug, guanfacine (GFC), decreased the NA metabolism. Doing these things helped to correct the behavior problems in the vitamin B6 deficiency mice. This research suggests that the behavior problems in the vitamin B6 deficiency mice are caused by an increase in the noradrenergic (NAergic) system.",2,B
70,23334322,"Pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP), the bioactive form of vitamin B6, reportedly functions as a prosthetic group for >4% of classified enzymatic activities of the cell. It is therefore not surprising that alterations of vitamin B6 metabolism have been associated with multiple human diseases. As a striking example, mutations in the gene coding for antiquitin, an evolutionary old aldehyde dehydrogenase, result in pyridoxine-dependent seizures, owing to the accumulation of a metabolic intermediate that inactivates PLP. In addition, PLP is required for the catabolism of homocysteine by transsulfuration. Hence, reduced circulating levels of B6 vitamers (including PLP as well as its major precursor pyridoxine) are frequently paralleled by hyperhomocysteinemia, a condition that has been associated with an increased risk for multiple cardiovascular diseases. During the past 30 years, an intense wave of clinical investigation has attempted to dissect the putative links between vitamin B6 and cancer. Thus, high circulating levels of vitamin B6, as such or as they reflected reduced amounts of circulating homocysteine, have been associated with improved disease outcome in patients bearing a wide range of hematological and solid neoplasms. More recently, the proficiency of vitamin B6 metabolism has been shown to modulate the adaptive response of tumor cells to a plethora of physical and chemical stress conditions. Moreover, elevated levels of pyridoxal kinase (PDXK), the enzyme that converts pyridoxine and other vitamin B6 precursors into PLP, have been shown to constitute a good, therapy-independent prognostic marker in patients affected by non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). Here, we will discuss the clinical relevance of vitamin B6 metabolism as a prognostic factor in cancer patients.","Pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP) is the active form of vitamin B6 in the body. PLP is involved in more than 4% of the chemical reactions of proteins in the cell. Changes in vitamin B6 metabolism have been associated with multiple human diseases. For example, mutations in the gene coding for antiquitin, a protein that appeared early in evolution, result in seizures. These seizures are due to an increase in a chemical (made during vitamin B6 metabolism) that stops the function of PLP. PLP is also required for the metabolism of homocysteine (an amino acid involved in vitamin B metabolism).. Lower blood levels of B6 vitamers (active vitamin B6 chemicals-PLP and pyridoxine) are associated with hyperhomocysteinemia (excess blood homocysteine). Hyperhomocysteinemia is associated with a higher risk of many cardiovascular diseases. During the past 30 years, a lot of research has tried to explain links between vitamin B6 and cancer. High blood levels of vitamin B6, or the related lower blood levels of homocysteine, have been associated with improved disease outcome in patients with blood and solid organ neoplasms. Recently, vitamin B6 metabolism has been shown to control tumor cells' ability to adjust to many different types of stress. Also, increased levels of pyridoxal kinase (PDXK-a protein involved in producing PLP), have been shown to predict good outcomes in patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC).

70,34578855,"There is little evidence regarding the association between serum vitamin B6 concentration and subsequent mortality. We aimed to evaluate the association of serum vitamin B6 concentration with all-cause, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and cancer mortality in the general population using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Our study examined 12,190 adults participating in NHANES from 2005 to 2010 in the United States. The mortality status was linked to National Death Index (NDI) records up to 31 December 2015. Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) is the biologically active form of vitamin B6. Vitamin B6 status was defined as deficient (PLP < 20 nmol/L), insufficient (PLP â‰¥ 20.0 and <30.0 nmol/L), and sufficient (PLP â‰¥ 30.0 nmol/L). We established Cox proportional-hazards models to estimate the associations of categorized vitamin B6 concentration and log-transformed PLP concentration with all-cause and cause-specific mortality by calculating hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs). In our study, serum vitamin B6 was sufficient in 70.6% of participants, while 12.8% of the subjects were deficient in vitamin B6. During follow-up, a total of 1244 deaths were recorded, including 294 cancer deaths and 235 CVD deaths. After multivariate adjustment in Cox regression, participants with higher serum vitamin B6 had a 15% (HR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.77, 0.93) reduced risk of all-cause mortality and a 19% (HR = 0.81, 95%CI = 0.68, 0.98) reduced risk for CVD mortality for each unit increment in natural log-transformed PLP. A higher log-transformed PLP was not significantly associated with a lower risk for cancer mortality. Compared with sufficient vitamin B6, deficient (HR = 1.37, 95% CI = 1.17, 1.60) and insufficient (HR = 1.19, 95%CI = 1.02, 1.38) vitamin B6 level were significantly associated with a higher risk for all-cause mortality. There was no significant association for cause-specific mortality. Participants with higher levels of vitamin B6 had a lower risk for all-cause mortality. These findings suggest that maintaining a sufficient level of serum vitamin B6 may lower the all-cause mortality risk in the general population.","There is little evidence about the connection beween blood levels of vitamin B6 and later mortality (death rate).

70,32899820,"Background: a large number of studies have linked vitamin B6 to inflammation and cardiovascular disease in the general population. However, it remains uncertain whether vitamin B6 is associated with cardiovascular outcome independent of inflammation. Methods: we measured plasma pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP), as an indicator of vitamin B6 status, at baseline in a population-based prospective cohort of 6249 participants of the Prevention of Renal and Vascular End-stage Disease (PREVEND) study who were free of cardiovascular disease. As indicators of low-grade systemic inflammation, we measured high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and GlycA; Results: median plasma PLP was 37.2 (interquartile range, 25.1-57.0) nmol/L. During median follow-up for 8.3 (interquartile range, 7.8-8.9) years, 409 non-fatal and fatal cardiovascular events (composite outcome) occurred. In the overall cohort, log transformed plasma PLP was associated with the composite outcome, independent of adjustment for age, sex, smoking, alcohol consumption, body mass index (BMI), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), total cholesterol:high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol ratio, and blood pressure (adjusted hazard ratio per increment of log plasma PLP, 0.66; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.47-0.93). However, adjustment for high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and GlycA increased the hazard ratio by 9% and 12% respectively, to non-significant hazard ratios of 0.72 (95% confidence interval, 0.51-1.01) and 0.74 (95% confidence interval, 0.53-1.05). The association of plasma PLP with cardiovascular risk was modified by gender (adjusted Pinteraction = 0.04). When stratified according to gender, in women the prospective association with cardiovascular outcome was independent of age, smoking, alcohol consumption, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and GlycA (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.50, 95% confidence interval, 0.27-0.94), while it was not in men (adjusted hazard, 0.99, 95% confidence interval, 0.65-1.51). Conclusions: in this population-based cohort, plasma PLP was associated with cardiovascular outcome, but this association was confounded by traditional risk factors and parameters of inflammation. Notably, the association of low plasma PLP with high risk of adverse cardiovascular outcome was modified by gender, with a stronger and independent association in women.","A large number of studies have linked vitamin B6 to inflammation and cardiovascular disease in the general population. It is not known if vitamin B6 is linked to future cardiovascular disease without inflammation. Researchers measured the amount of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) in the blood at the start of a prevention study in patients without cardiovascular disease. Levels of PLP in blood can show how much vitamin B6 is present in the body. Low-level widespread inflammation in the body was measured by blood levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and GlyA. The blood level of PLP was about  37.2 nmol/L. These patients were followed up for about 8 years. During this time, 409 cardiovascular diseases events occurred, some were fatal. In these patients, the amount of PLP in the blood was linked to the cardiovascular events that occurred. This link did not depend on other risk factors like age, sex, smoking, drinking alcohol, body weight (BMI), kidney function (eGFR), cholesterol levels, or blood pressure. But, the amount of hsCRP and GlyA in the blood was linked to an increase in the risk of having these cardiovascular events occurring. Also, this link of the amount of PLP in the blood and the risk of getting cardiovascular disease was affected by gender. In women, the link between the amount of PLP in the blood and getting cardiovascular disease did not depend on the other risk factors like age, smoking, drinking alcohol, or blood levels of hsCRP and GlyA. In men, the link was not as independent of these other risk factors. In these patients, the level of PLP in blood was linked to getting cardiovascular disease.

70,28275126,"Background: Higher plasma concentrations of the vitamin B-6 marker pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) have been associated with reduced colorectal cancer (CRC) risk. Inflammatory processes, including vitamin B-6 catabolism, could explain such findings. Objective: We investigated 3 biomarkers of vitamin B-6 status in relation to CRC risk. Design: This was a prospective case-control study of 613 CRC cases and 1190 matched controls nested within the Northern Sweden Health and Disease Study (n = 114,679). Participants were followed from 1985 to 2009, and the median follow-up from baseline to CRC diagnosis was 8.2 y. PLP, pyridoxal, pyridoxic acid (PA), 3-hydroxykynurenine, and xanthurenic acids (XAs) were measured in plasma with the use of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. We calculated relative and absolute risks of CRC for PLP and the ratios 3-hydroxykynurenine:XA (HK:XA), an inverse marker of functional vitamin B-6 status, and PA:(PLP + pyridoxal) (PAr), a marker of inflammation and oxidative stress and an inverse marker of vitamin B-6 status. Results: Plasma PLP concentrations were associated with a reduced CRC risk for the third compared with the first quartile and for PLP sufficiency compared with deficiency [OR: 0.60 (95% CI: 0.44, 0.81) and OR: 0.55 (95% CI: 0.37, 0.81), respectively].

For HK:XA and PAr, the findings were mainly observed in study participants with <10.5 y of follow-up between sampling and diagnosis. Conclusions: Vitamin B-6 deficiency as measured by plasma PLP is associated with a clear increase in CRC risk. Furthermore, our analyses of novel markers of functional vitamin B-6 status and vitamin B-6-associated oxidative stress and inflammation suggest a role in tumor progression rather than initiation.","Higher blood levels of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) have been linked to lower risk of colorectal cancer (CRC).

Researchers measured chemicals that are signs (biomarkers) of the amount of vitamin B6 in blood. They studied these 3 biomarkers In relation to the risk of CRC. This large study was done in Sweden and compared 613 participants with CRC to people without CRC. The participants were followed from 1985 to 2009. From the start of the study to the time of the CRC diagnosis was about 8 years. The biomarkers measured in the blood were PLP, pyridoxal, pyridoxic acid (PA), 3-hydroxykynurenine (HK), and xanthurenic acids (XAs) Researchers calculated the risks of CRC and biomarkers for vitamin B6 status, inflammation, and oxidative stress. Oxidative stress occurs when the level of free radicals is too high compared to the level of antioxidants in the body. These biomarkers included PLP, HK:XA, and PAr (PA: (PLP + pyridoxal)). Higher blood PLP levels were linked to lower CRC risk for many participants. PLP sufficiency (enough) compared to deficiency (not enough) was also linked to lower CRC risk. The calculated biomarkers, HK: XA and PAr were both associated with an increased risk for getting CRC. For HK:XA and PAr, this risk was mainly seen in participants with less than 10.5 years of follow-up between blood samples taken at the start of the study and the CRC diagnosis. Vitamin B6 deficiency (blood PLP) is associated with a clear increase in CRC risk. The other biomarkers studied (showing vitamin B6 status and vitamin B6-associated oxidative stress and inflammation), may play a role in cancer development rather than starting it.",2,B

71,12816345,"Achondroplasia, the most common form of human dwarfism is a rare condition that occurs in approximately 1:20,000 births. The major clinical outcome of Achondroplasia is attenuated growth, rhizomelic shortening of the long bones and craniofacial abnormalities. As of today there is no pharmacological treatment for Achondroplasia. Some improvement in the patients well being and daily function can be achieved by a surgical limb lengthening procedure. Growth hormone treatment seems to have only modest short term success and to lack long term benefits. Achondroplasia results from a single point mutation in Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 3 (FGFR3). In 97% of the patients, there is a Glycine to Arginine substitution at position 380 within the FGFR-3 transmembrane domain leading to receptor overactivation. This FGF receptor tyrosine kinase is expressed by chondrocytes in the growth plate of developing long bones and plays a crucial role in bone growth. Genetic disruption of the FGFR-3 gene in mice leads to a remarkable increase in the length of the vertebral column and long bones. This suggests that overaction of FGFR3 signaling may specifically impair chondrocyte function within the epiphyseal growth plates and cause Achondroplasia. Reconstituted normal bone growth may therefore be achieved by attenuation of FGFR3 signaling in the appropriate cells within the growth plate. It is highly conceivable that drug development strategies aimed either towards blocking extracellular ligand binding or towards intracellular checkpoints along the FGF signal transduction cascade, may prove successful in the treatment of Achondroplasia.

71,17561467,"The most frequent type of rhizomelic dwarfism, achondroplasia (ACH), is caused by mutations in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene. Mutations in FGFR3 result in skeletal dysplasias of variable severity, including mild phenotypic effects in hypochondroplasia (HCH), severe phenotypic effects in thanatophoric dysplasia types I (TDI) and II (TDII), and severe but survivable phenotypic effects in severe achondroplasia with developmental delay and acanthosis nigricans (SADDAN). To explore the molecular mechanisms that result in the different phenotypes, we investigated the kinetics of mutated versions of FGFR3. First, we assayed the phosphorylation states of the mutated FGFR3s and found that the level of phosphorylation in TDI-FGFR3 was lower than in ACH-FGFR3, although the other mutants were phosphorylated according to phenotypic severity. Second, we analyzed the duration of the phosphorylation. TDI-FGFR3 was not highly phosphorylated under ligand-free conditions, but the peak phosphorylation levels of TDI-FGFR3 and ACH-FGFR3 were maintained for 30 min after stimulation with FGF-1. Moreover, ligand-dependent phosphorylation of TDI-FGFR3, but not ACH-FGFR3, lasted for more than 8 h after FGF-1 administration. The other mutant proteins showed sustained phosphorylation independent of ligand presence. Third, we investigated the intracellular localization of the mutant proteins. Immunofluorescence analysis showed accumulations of TDII-FGFR3, SADDAN-FGFR3, and a portion of TDI-FGFR3 in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Based on these data, we concluded that sustained phosphorylation of FGFR3 causes chondrodysplasia, and the phenotypic severity depends on the proportion of ER-localized mutant FGFR3. In FGFR3 signaling, the transcription factor, signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis of chondrocytes. Here we reveal that phospholipase C gamma (PLCgamma) mediates FGFR3-induced STAT1 activation. Both PLCgamma and STAT1 were activated by FGFR3 signaling, but a dominant-negative form of PLCgamma (DN-PLCgamma) remarkably reduced STAT1 phosphorylation. Apoptosis assays revealed that the constitutively active forms of FGFR3 (TDII-FGFR3) and STAT1 (STAT1-C) induce apoptosis of chondrogenic ATDC5 cells via caspase activity. DN-PLCgamma reduced the apoptosis of ATDC5 cells expressing TDII-FGFR3, but over-expression of both DN-PLCgamma and STAT1-C induced apoptosis. Therefore, we conclude that a PLCgamma-STAT1 pathway mediates apoptotic signaling by FGFR3.","The most frequent type of dwarfism, achondroplasia (ACH), is caused by mutations in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene.

To explore the molecular mechanisms that result in the different bone growth impairments and with varying severity, the authors investigated the properties of mutated versions of FGFR3. First, the authors checked for addition of a phosphate group to FGFR3. Attachement of phosphate groups can change the properites of the receptor and where it is located in the cell. They found that different parts of the receptor had phosphate groups depending on the type of mutation. Second, the authors looked for how long the phosphate groups were present in the mutated FGFR3 receptor. _ _ Generally, the mutated proteins showed longer presence of the phosphate group on FGFR3. Third, the authors investigated where in the cell the mutated proteins were located. Image analysis of the cells showed that mutated FGFR3 was in the part of the cell where proteins are made. Based on these data, the authors conclude that sustained presence of the phosphate group of FGFR3 causes bone growth impairment and the severity depends on the proportion of the mutated FGFR3 present in the region of the cell involved in synthesizing proteins.

72,20498829,"Early detection of many disorders, mainly inherited, is feasible with population-wide analysis of newborn dried blood spot samples. Phenylketonuria was the prototype disorder for newborn screening (NBS) and early dietary treatment has resulted in vastly improved outcomes for this disorder. Testing for primary hypothyroidism and cystic fibrosis (CF) was later added to NBS programs following the development of robust immunoassays and molecular testing. Current CF testing usually relies on a combined immunoreactive trypsin/mutation detection strategy. Multiplex testing for approximately 25 inborn errors of metabolism using tandem mass spectrometry is a relatively recent addition to NBS. The simultaneous introduction of many disorders has caused some re-evaluation of the traditional guidelines for NBS, because very rare disorders or disorders without good treatments can be included with minimal effort. NBS tests for many other disorders have been developed, but these are less uniformly applied or are currently considered developmental. This review focuses on Australasian NBS practices.","Many disorders (but mostly ones that are inherited) can be detected early by looking at dried blood spot samples of newborns across the population. Phenylketonuria is an inherited disorder that can cause many issues with the brain. This disorder was the original example of how newborn screening can result in big improvements for health outcomes. After improved lab tests for hypothyroidism (a gland disorder) and Cystic Fibrosis (CF), an inherited disorder that causes lung infections, these diseases were added to newborn screening programs. Current testing for CF usually relies on a combination of testing for genetic mutations that cause CF and testing for an enzyme that is reduced by CF. Combined testing for about 25 genetic mutations relating to metabolism is a relatively recent addition to newborn screening. The addition of many disorders all at once has led to some reconsideration of the way newborn screening is usually done. This is because it is easy to include tests for disorders that are very rare or don’t have good treatments.

72,18203033,"The aim of newborn screening is to detect newborns with serious, treatable disorders so as to facilitate appropriate interventions to avoid or ameliorate adverse outcomes. Mass biochemical testing of newborn babies was pioneered in the 1960s with the introduction of screening for phenylketonuria, a rare inborn error of metabolism, tested by using a dried blood spot sample. The next disorder introduced into screening programs was congenital hypothyroidism and a few more much rarer disorders were gradually included. Two recent advances have greatly changed the pace: modification of tandem mass spectrometry and DNA extraction and analysis from newborn screening dried blood spot. These two technologies make the future possibilities of newborn screening seem almost unlimited. Newborn screening tests are usually carried out on a dried blood spot sample, for which there are special analytical considerations. Dried blood spot calibrators and controls, prepared on the same lot number of filter paper, are needed. Methods have a co-efficient of variation of about 10% due to the increased variability of a dried filter paper sample compared with other biochemical samples. The haematocrit is an additional variable not able to be measured. Also of importance is obtaining a balance between the sensitivity and specificity of each assay. Fixing cut-off points for action needs consideration of what is an acceptable percentage of the population to recall for further testing. Few assays are 100% discriminatory. Programs in Australasia currently screen for at least 30 disorders. Detection of these requires not only the assay of a primary marker but often determination of a ratio of that marker with another, or possibly an alternative assay, for example a DNA mutation. The most important disorders screened for are described briefly: phenylketonuria, primary congenital hypothyroidism, cystic fibrosis, the galactosaemias, medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency and congenital adrenal hyperplasia, together with several other disorders detectable by tandem mass spectrometry. Newborn screening deals with rare disorders and benefit cannot be shown easily without very large pilot studies. There have been randomised controlled trials of screening for cystic fibrosis, and now several studies are beginning to establish the benefit of tandem mass spectrometry screening for disorders of fatty acid and amino acid metabolism. Two things will influence the new directions for newborn screening: the development of effective treatments for hitherto untreatable disorders, and advancing technology, enabling new testing strategies to be developed. There are novel treatments on the horizon for many discrete disorders. Susceptibility testing has recently been considered for newborn screening application, but is more controversial. Newborn screening has entered a new and exciting phase, with an explosion of new treatments, new technologies, and, possibly in the future, new preventive strategies.","The goal of newborn screening is to detect newborns with serious, treatable disorders. This allows appropriate action to be taken to prevent or lessen bad outcomes.

This testing was done by using dried blood spot samples. The next disorder introduced into screening programs was congenital hypothyroidism, which is an inherited disorder of the thyroid gland, which controls metabolism. A few more much rarer disorders were gradually included. Two recent advances have greatly change the pace. These are modification of tandem mass spectrometry (an advanced chemical detection technique, also known as MS/MS) and DNA analysis from newborn screening dried blood spots. These two technologies make the future possibilities of newborn screening seem almost unlimited. Newborn screening test are usually done with a dried blood spot sample, which needs to be considered when analyzing. Extra dried blood spots need to be prepared on the same filter paper to calibrate the tests. Since dried filter paper samples have more variability than other types of samples, the results of these tests can vary by about 10% or more. Additionally, the amount of red blood cells cannot be measured. It is also important to balance how sensitive the test is (how good it is at finding a problem) with how specific it is (how sure you can be when a problem is found). In deciding how to balance these, we need to consider how many people it is acceptable to bring back for more testing. Not many tests are perfectly accurate. Programs in Australasia currently screen for at least 30 disorders. Detecting these disorders often requires more than just knowing one amount. It can require knowing relative amounts of two different things, or could require an additional alternative test, like a genetic test.

These are phenylketonuria, hypothyroidism, Cystic Fibrosis (CF), galactosaemias, Medium-Chain Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency, Glutaryl-CoA Dehydrogenase (GCDH) deficiency and Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH), along with several other disorders detectable by MS/MS.

72,9483156,"OBJECTIVES. To establish a database of literature and other evidence on neonatal screening programmes and technologies for inborn errors of metabolism. To undertake a systematic review of the data as a basis for evaluation of newborn screening for inborn errors of metabolism. To prepare an objective summary of the evidence on the appropriateness and need for various existing and possible neonatal screening programmes for inborn errors of metabolism in relation to the natural history of these diseases. To identify gaps in existing knowledge and make recommendations for required primary research. To make recommendations for the future development and organisation of neonatal screening for inborn errors of metabolism in the UK. HOW THE RESEARCH WAS CONDUCTED. There were three parts to the research. A systematic review of the literature on inborn errors of metabolism, neonatal screening programmes, new technologies for screening and economic factors. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied, and a working database of relevant papers was established. All selected papers were read by two or three experts and were critically appraised using a standard format. Seven criteria for a screening programme, based on the principles formulated by Wilson and Jungner (WHO, 1968), were used to summarise the evidence. These were as follows. Clinically and biochemically well-defined disorder. Known incidence in populations relevant to the UK. Disorder associated with significant morbidity or mortality. Effective treatment available. Period before onset during which intervention improves outcome. Ethical, safe, simple and robust screening test. Cost-effectiveness of screening. A questionnaire which was sent to all newborn screening laboratories in the UK. Site visits to assess new methodologies for newborn screening. The classical definition of an inborn error of metabolism was used (i.e., a monogenic disease resulting in deficient activity in a single enzyme in a pathway of intermediary metabolism). RESEARCH FINDINGS. INBORN ERRORS OF METABOLISM. Phenylketonuria (PKU) (incidence 1:12,000) fulfilled all the screening criteria and could be used as the 'gold standard' against which to review other disorders despite significant variation in methodologies, sample collection and timing of screening and inadequacies in the infrastructure for notification and continued care of identified patients. Of the many disorders of organic acid and fatty acid metabolism, a case can only be made for the introduction of newborn screening for glutaric aciduria type 1 (GA1; estimated incidence 1:40,000) and medium-chain acyl CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency (estimated incidence 1:8000-1:15,000). Therapeutic advances for GA1 offer prevention of neurological damage but further investigation is required into the costs and benefits of screening for this disorder. MCAD deficiency is simply and cheaply treatable, preventing possible early death and neurological handicap. Neonatal screening for these diseases is dependent upon the introduction of tandem mass spectrometry (tandem MS). This screening could however also simultaneously detect some other commonly-encountered disorders of organic acid metabolism with a collective incidence of 1:15,000. Neonatal screening for congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency (incidence 1:17,000) has been shown to be beneficial in other countries and similar benefits should accrue in the UK. A national programme of neonatal screening for CAH would be justified, with reassessment after an agreed period. Biotinidase deficiency is of low incidence in the UK (estimated 1:100,000), but this may be outweighed by the simplicity of the screening methodology and the benefits in prevention.","Our first goal in this article was to establish a database of literature and other evidence on newborn screening programmes and technology for genetic disorders related to metabolism. We also aimed to rigorously review data to evaluate newborn screening for genetic disorders related to metabolism. We aimed to summarize the evidence for whether various newborn screening programs for genetic disorders related to metabolism are appropriate and necessary. We aimed to make this summary in relation to the natural history of these diseases, and for both existing and possible programs. We further aimed to identify gaps in knowledge and make recommendations for further research that is needed. Finally, we aimed to make recommendations for the future development and organisation of newborn screening for genetic disorders related to metabolism in the UK. There were three parts to this research. We rigorously reviewed research papers on genetic disorders related to metabolism, newborn screening programs, new technologies for screening, and economic factors. We decided how we would include or exclude papers, and made a working database of relevant papers. All the papers we selected were read by two or three experts and were critically assessed using a standard format. Seven criteria for a screening programme, based on the principles formulated by Wilson and Jungner (WHO, 1968), were used to summarise the evidence. These were the following: The disorder is well defined by signs and symptoms. The disease occurs in populations relevant to the UK. The disorder is associated with serious health problems or death. Effective treatment is available for the disease. The disorder can be helped by addressing it in the time before it appears. There is an ethical, safe, simple and robust screening test for the disorder. Screening for the disorder is cost-effective. A questionnaire was sent to all newborn screening laboratories in the UK. There are site visits to assess new methodologies for newborn screening. We used the traditional way of defining a genetic disorder related to metabolism. This was that the disorder was caused by a single mutated gene that affected a single type of enzyme needed for metabolism. We found that phenylketonuria matched all the                 criteria. This disorder could be used as a gold standard when comparing other disorders, even though the screening process can vary and systems for notifying patients are not good enough. Of the many disorders of metabolism of organic and fatty acids, we can only make the case for newborn screening of Glutaric Aciduria type 1 (GA1) and Medium-Chain Acy-CoA Dehydrogenase (MCAD deficiency). Advancements in therapy for GA1 can prevent damage to the brain and nerves but more research into the costs and benefits of screening for this disorder is needed. MCAD deficiency can be treated simply and cheaply, preventing possible early death and brain handicap. Newborn screening for these diseases depends on the introduction of tandem Mass Spectrometry (tandem MS) technology. But, this screening could also detect some other disorders at the same time. These other disorders are related to organic acid metabolism and happen to one in 15,000 people. Newborn screening for congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) has worked well in other countries and the UK should see similar benefits. This disease occurs in one in 17,000 people. A national programme of newborn screening for CAH would be justified, and could be looked at again after an agreed period of time. Another disorder, biotinidase deficiency, is rare in the UK (estimated at one in 100,000), but that may be outweighed by how simple the screening process is and the benefits of preventing the disease.",2,C

Newborn screening measures specific substances in various ways. Using the most sensitive screening tests can ultimately reduce or eliminate permanent consequences. Specificity of a test distinguishes true negative results from false negative results (when the test is negative but the patient actually has the disease). In general, this article discusses disorders that have treatments and that can be detected by routine and expanded newborn screening. We give recommendations for testing by a general practice doctor, with confirmation by a metabolic or endocrine specialist. We organize disorders in a table by the physical process they affect in the body or by the substance that is tested. In doing this we also pay attention to how the disease first appears, lab tests that can confirm the disorders, and treatments available. There are many challenges for following up with patients, including diagnosis and appropriate understanding of the consequences of the disorders. Meeting these challenges will require information. This can only be gained with large-scale studies that follow children identified by newborn screening over time to see their outcomes. Newborn screening can only fully serve families once we have this knowledge.",2,C
72,24295058,"Inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) are a phenotypically and genetically heterogeneous group of disorders caused by a defect in a metabolic pathway, leading to malfunctioning metabolism and/or the accumulation of toxic intermediate metabolites. To date, more than 1000 different IEM have been identified. While individually rare, the cumulative incidence has been shown to be upwards of 1 in 800. Clinical presentations are protean, complicating diagnostic pathways. IEM are present in all ethnic groups and across every age. Some IEM are amenable to treatment, with promising outcomes. However, high clinical suspicion alone is not sufficient to reduce morbidities and mortalities. In the last decade, due to the advent of tandem mass spectrometry, expanded newborn screening (NBS) has become a mandatory public health strategy in most developed and developing countries. The technology allows inexpensive simultaneous detection of more than 30 different metabolic disorders in one single blood spot specimen at a cost of about USD 10 per baby, with commendable analytical accuracy and precision. The sensitivity and specificity of this method can be up to 99% and 99.995%, respectively, for most amino acid disorders, organic acidemias, and fatty acid oxidation defects. Cost-effectiveness studies have confirmed that the savings achieved through the use of expanded NBS programs are significantly greater than the costs of implementation. The adverse effects of false positive results are negligible in view of the economic health benefits generated by expanded NBS and these could be minimized through increased education, better communication, and improved technologies. Local screening agencies should be given the autonomy to develop their screening programs in order to keep pace with international advancements. The development of biochemical genetics is closely linked with expanded NBS. With ongoing advancements in nanotechnology and molecular genomics, the field of biochemical genetics is still expanding rapidly. The potential of tandem mass spectrometry is extending to cover more disorders. Indeed, the use of genetic markers in T-cell receptor excision circles for severe combined immunodeficiency is one promising example. NBS represents the highest volume of genetic testing. It is more than a test and it warrants systematic healthcare service delivery across the pre-analytical, analytical, and post-analytical phases. There should be a comprehensive reporting system entailing genetic counselling as well as short-term and long-term follow-up. It is essential to integrate existing clinical IEM services with the expanded NBS program to enable close communication between the laboratory, clinicians, and allied health parties. In this review, we will discuss the history of IEM, its clinical presentations in children and adult patients, and its incidence among different ethnicities; the history and recent expansion of NBS, its cost-effectiveness, associated pros and cons, and the ethical issues that can arise; the analytical aspects of tandem mass spectrometry and post-analytical perspectives regarding result interpretation.","Inborn Errors of Metabolism (IEM) are hereditary diseases that affect how the body processes nutrients. They vary both in how they appear in a patient and in they underlying genetic causes. To date, more than 1000 different IEM have been identified. Though each individual disease is rare, taken altogether the rate has been shown to be upwards of 1 in 800. The way the diseases appear in patients can vary. This makes it difficult it diagnose them. IEM are present in all ethnic groups and across every age. Some IEM can be treated, with promising outcomes. However, doctors suspecting these diseases from patient exams is not enough alone to reduce health problems and death. In the last decade, expanded newborn screening has become a mandatory public health strategy in most developed and developing countries. This is due to the advent of a chemical detection technology called tandem mass spectrometry. This technology allows more than 30 different metabolic disorders to be detected at low cost in one single blood spot specimen. The cost is about 10 dollars per baby, and the tests are highly accurate. Studies of cost-effectiveness have confirmed that the savings from expanded newborn screening programs are much greater than the costs of running them. The side effects of false positives (when the test is positive but the patient does not have the disease) are not significant in light of the economic and health benefits produced by expanded newborn screening. Further, these side effects could be lessened with more education, better communication, and improved technology. Local screening agencies should be given the freedom to create their own screening programs so they can keep up with international advancements. Improvements in knowledge of genes and how they affect the body are closely linked with expanded newborn screening. This knowledge is growing because of advancements in nanotechnology (working with things at the microscopic level) and molecular genomics (the study of how changes DNA drive hereditary outcomes). The potential of tandem mass spectrometry is extending to cover more disorders. In fact, one promising example is the use of genetic markers for Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID), a disease that makes people extremely vulnerable to germs.

Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) for pain at rest registered in the clinical sheet was retrieved for all patients and analyzed with respect to the spinal anaesthesia given for the surgery, local analgesia, analgesia protocol adopted during the postoperative days in the Orthopaedic Unit, the antalgic treatment given during the stay within the Rehabilitation Unit, the postoperative consumption of rescue pain medication, and any collateral effect due to the analgesic therapy. Patients reached standard functional abilities (walking at least 50 meters and climbing/descending stairs) at a mean length of 8 days without medication-related complications. Mean NRS during the time of stay was 1.3 ± 0.3 for THR and 1.3 ± 0.2 for TKR) and maximum mean NRS was 1.8 ± 0.5 for TKR and 1.8 ± 0.6 for THR.

73,24996539,"Background: Surgical pain is managed with multi-modal anaesthesia in total hip replacement (THR) and total knee replacement (TKR). It is unclear whether including local anaesthetic infiltration before wound closure provides additional pain control. Methods: We performed a systematic review of randomised controlled trials of local anaesthetic infiltration in patients receiving THR or TKR. We searched MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane CENTRAL to December 2012. Two reviewers screened abstracts, extracted data, and contacted authors for unpublished outcomes and data. Outcomes collected were post-operative pain at rest and during activity after 24 and 48 hours, opioid requirement, mobilisation, hospital stay and complications. When feasible, we estimated pooled treatment effects using random effects meta-analyses. Results: In 13 studies including 909 patients undergoing THR, patients receiving local anaesthetic infiltration experienced a greater reduction in pain at 24 hours at rest by standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.61 (95% CI -1.05, -0.16; p = 0.008) and by SMD -0.43 (95% CI -0.78 -0.09; p = 0.014) at 48 hours during activity. In TKR, diverse multi-modal regimens were reported. In 23 studies including 1439 patients undergoing TKR, local anaesthetic infiltration reduced pain on average by SMD -0.40 (95% CI -0.58, -0.22; p < 0.001) at 24 hours at rest and by SMD -0.27 (95% CI -0.50, -0.05; p = 0.018) at 48 hours during activity, compared with patients receiving no infiltration or placebo. There was evidence of a larger reduction in studies delivering additional local anaesthetic after wound closure. There was no evidence of pain control additional to that provided by femoral nerve block. Patients receiving local anaesthetic infiltration spent on average an estimated 0.83 (95% CI 1.54, 0.12; p = 0.022) and 0.87 (95% CI 1.62, 0.11; p = 0.025) fewer days in hospital after THR and TKR respectively, had reduced opioid consumption, earlier mobilisation, and lower incidence of vomiting. Few studies reported long-term outcomes. Conclusions: Local anaesthetic infiltration is effective in reducing short-term pain and hospital stay in patients receiving THR and TKR. Studies should assess whether local anaesthetic infiltration can prevent long-term pain. Enhanced pain control with additional analgesia through a catheter should be weighed against a possible infection risk.","In Total Hip Replacement (THR) and Total Knee Replacement (TKR), pain from surgery is managed with multiple types of anaesthesia used together. It is not clear if applying a local anaesthetic directly to the wound before sewing it up provides additional pain control. We systematically reviewed randomised controlled trials of using local anaesthetic in patients having THR or TKR. We searched several medical literature databases up to December 2012. The information we gathered from the studies was: pain after surgery, both at rest and during activity after 24 and 48 hours, whether opioids were needed, when and how much patients walked, hospital stay, and additional problems cause by the surgery. In 13 studies including 909 patients having THR, patients that got local anaesthetic had a bigger reduction in pain at 24 hours at rest and at 48 hours during activity. In TKR, various regimens using multiple types of anesthesia were reported. In 23 studies including 1439 patients having TKR, using local anaesthetic reduced pain at 24 hours at rest and at 48 hours during activity, compared with patients receiving no local anesthetic, or placebo (sham treatment so patients were not biased). In studies where more local anaesthetic was used after closing the wound, there was evidence of a bigger reduction. There was no evidence of pain control on top of what was provided by femoral nerve block, a type of local anesthetic applied directly to a large nerve in the thigh. Patients that got local anaesthetic spent, on average, an estimated 0.83 fewer days in hospital after THR and 0.87 fewer days in hospital after TKR. They also had took fewer opioids, walked earlier, and vomited less. Not many studies reported long-term outcomes. Our first conclusion is that local anaesthesia is effective in reducing short-term pain and hospital stay in patients having THR and TKR. Second, studies should assess whether local anaesthesia can prevent long-term pain. Finally, enhanced pain control with additional medicine through a catheter should be weighed against a possible infection risk.",2,C

73,30066029,"Introduction: Postoperative pain management options are of great importance for patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty, as joint replacement surgery is reported to be one of the most painful surgical procedures. This study demonstrates pain outcome until 4 weeks postoperatively and evaluates factors influencing pain in the postoperative course after total hip arthroplasty. Materials and methods: A total of 103 patients were included in this prospective cohort trial and underwent total hip arthroplasty. Postoperative pain was described using a numerical rating scale (NRS); demographic data and perioperative parameters were correlated with postoperative pain. Results: Evaluation of pain scores in the postoperative course showed a constant decrease in the first postoperative week (mean NRS 3.1 on day 1 to mean NRS 2.3 on day 8) and, then, a perpetual increase for 3 days (mean NRS 2.6 on day 9 to mean NRS 2.3 on day 12). Afterwards, a continuous pain-level decrease was stated (continuous to a mean NRS 0.9 on day 29). No correlation was found between the potential influencing factors sex, age, body mass index, duration of surgery, ASA score, and postoperative pain levels, but a high significant correlation could be stated for preoperative pain levels and postoperative pain intensity (pain while moving p < 0.02 to p < 0.05 depending on the time period ""week 1 postoperatively"", ""week 2-4"", or ""week 1-4""; pain while resting p < 0.001, in all the measured time intervals, respectively). Conclusion: Increasing pain levels after the first week postoperatively, for 3 days, are most likely to be caused by the change to more extensive mobilization and physiotherapy in the rehabilitation unit. No significant influence or correlation on the intensity of postoperative pain could be found while evaluating potential predictors except preoperative pain levels. Pain management has to take these findings into account in the future to further increase patients' satisfaction in the postoperative course after total hip arthroplasty and to adapt pain management programs.","Options for managing pain after surgery are very important for patients having a hip replacement. This is because joint replacement surgery is reported to be one of the most painful surgical procedures. This study shows pain outcome until 4 weeks after surgery and evaluates factors that influence pain during followup after a hip replacement. This was a study that followed a group of patients over time. It included a total of 103 patients that had a hip replacement. Pain following surgery was described using a Numerical Rating Scale (NRS). Demographic information and ways in which the surgery was done were correlated with the amount of pain after surgery. Looking at pain scores following surgery showed a constant decrease in the first week after surgery (average NRS 3.1 on day 1 to average NRS 2.3 on day 8). After that, there was a continuous increase for 3 days (average NRS 2.6 on day 9 to average NRS 2.3 on day 12). Afterwards, a continuous pain-level decrease was stated (continuous to a mean NRS 0.9 on day 29). No correlation was found between the potential factors of sex, age, body mass index, duration of surgery, ASA score (used to measure fitness for surgery), and pain levels following the operation. However, a there was a significant correlation between pain levels before surgery and after. In conclusion, pain levels increased after the first week following surgery, for 3 days. This is most likely caused by the change to more extensive mobilization and physiotherapy in the rehabilitation unit. We did not find any significant association of several potential predictors with the intensity of pain following surgery. The only exception was the amount of pain before surgery. When managing pain, doctors need to account for these results in the future. This is needed to further increase patients' satisfaction following hip replacement and to adapt pain management programs.",2,C
73,33709165,"Introduction: Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is reported to be one of the most painful surgical procedures. Perioperative management and rehabilitation patterns are of great importance for the success of the procedure. The aim of this cohort study was the evaluation of function, mobilization and pain scores during the inpatient stay (6 days postoperatively) and 4 weeks after fast-track THA. Materials and methods: A total of 102 consecutive patients were included in this retrospective cohort trial after minimally invasive cementless total hip arthroplasty under spinal anesthesia in a fast-track setup. The extent of mobilization under full-weight-bearing with crutches (walking distance in meters and necessity of nurse aid) and pain values using a numerical rating scale (NRS) were measured. Function was evaluated measuring the range of motion (ROM) and the ability of sitting on a chair, walking and personal hygiene. Furthermore, circumferences of thighs were measured to evaluate the extent of postoperative swelling. The widespread Harris Hip Score (HHS) was used to compare results pre- and 4 weeks postoperatively. Results: Evaluation of pain scores in the postoperative course showed a constant decrease in the first postoperative week (days 1-6 postoperatively). The pain scores before surgery were significantly higher than surgery (day 6), during mobilization (p < 0.001), at rest (p < 0.001) and at night (p < 0.001). All patients were able to mobilize on the day of surgery. In addition, there was a significant improvement in independent activities within the first 6 days postoperatively: sitting on a chair (p < 0.001), walking (p < 0.001) and personal hygiene (p < 0.001). There was no significant difference between the measured preoperative and postoperative (day 6 after surgery) thigh circumferences above the knee joint. Compared to preoperatively, there was a significant (p < 0.001) improvement of the HHS 4 weeks after surgery. In 100% of the cases, the operation was reported to be successful and all of the treated patients would choose a fast-track setup again. Conclusion: Application of a fast-track scheme is effective regarding function and mobilization of patients. Low pain values and rapid improvement of walking distance confirms the success of the fast-track concept in the immediate postoperative course. Future prospective studies have to confirm the results comparing a conventional and a fast-track pathway.","Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA, or hip replacement) is reported to be one of the most painful surgical procedures.

The aim of the study was to evaluate function, ability to walk, and pain scores during the inpatient stay (6 days following surgery) and 4 weeks after the procedure. To perform the study, we included a total of 102 consecutive patients that had previously had minimally invasive cementless THA under spinal anesthesia in a fast-track setup. We measured how far patients could walk under their full weight with crutches, and how much a nurse had to help. We also measured pain using a Numerical Rating Scale (NRS). We looked at function as measured by the range of motion (ROM) and the ability to sit on a chair, to walk and to maintain personal hygiene. On top of that, we measured circumferences of patients’ thighs to look at how much swelling there was after surgery. We used the widely used Harris Hip Score (HHS) to compare results before surgery and 4 weeks after surgery. Looking at pain scores following surgery showed a constant decrease in the first week (days 1-6 after surgery). The pain scores before surgery were significantly higher than day 6 after surgery, when attempting to walk, at rest, and at night. All patients were able to walk on the day of surgery. In addition, there was a significant improvement in independent activities within the first 6 days following surgery. These activities were sitting on a chair, walking and personal hygiene. There was no significant difference between the thigh circumferences above the knee joint, measured before surgery and on day 6 after surgery. Compared to before surgery, there was a significant improvement of the HHS 4 weeks after surgery. In 100% of the cases, the operation was reported to be successful and all of the treated patients would choose a fast-track setup again. In conclusion, application of a fast-track program is effective for function and ability of patients to walk. Further, low pain values and fast improvement of walking distance confirms that the fast-track plan immediately after surgery is a success. Finally, future studies that follow patients over time have to confirm the results by comparing a conventional and a fast-track plan.",2,C

Historically, opioids were the mainstay of perioperative pain control. However, opioids are associated with significant downsides. Preemptive use of a multimodal pain management approach has become the standard of care to manage pain after hip and knee arthroplasty. Multimodal pain management uses oral medicines, peripheral nerve blocks, intra-articular injections, and other tools to reduce the need for opioids.

73,31352132,"Background: Pain management after total knee arthroplasty and total hip arthroplasty is pivotal, as it determines the outcome of the recovery process after surgery. Ineffective pain control results in many postoperative complications and hinders successful recovery. In recent years, the transition from opioids to a multimodal pain management approach after total knee and total hip arthroplasty has increasingly become an alternative. This is due to the multitude of adverse effects associated with opioids. As a result, the use of non-opioid interventions such as acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, gabapentinoids, and ketamine, and techniques such as peripheral nerve block and local infiltration analgesia have become more favorable. Objectives: This paper aims to summarize literature around the effectiveness of non-opioid interventions as part of a multimodal pain management after total knee and total hip arthroplasty. Methods: A literature review was conducted to provide evidence-based information with respect to pain management during the postoperative period in order to enhance the pain recovery process. The literature chosen was extracted through the electronic databases PubMed, CINAHL, and Embase. Twenty-seven eligible articles were identified that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Results: Literary evidence shows that non-opioid interventions such as acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, gabapentinoids, ketamine, peripheral nerve blocks, and local infiltration analgesia benefit patients after total knee and total hip arthroplasty for pain management. However, further quality research trials are necessary for more conclusive evidence-based information. Conclusion: Selective literature supports the use of non-opioid interventions as part of a multimodal analgesics regimen for effective pain management after total knee and total hip arthroplasty.","Taking care of pain after knee replacement and and hip replacement is critical because it determines the how the patient recovers after surgery. Ways of controlling pain that are not effective causes many additional problems after surgery and hinders successful recovery. In recent years, changing from opioids after knee and hip replacement to using multiple pain medicines at once has increasingly become an alternative. This is because of the many side effects of opioids. As a result, the use of non-opioid treatments and techniques such as peripheral nerve block, which directly numbs a large nerve, and local anesthetic have become more favorable. Non-opioid treatments include acetaminophen (Tylenol®), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors, gabapentinoids (such as Lyrica or Neurontin), and ketamine. This paper aims to summarize literature about the effectiveness of non-opioid treatments as part of a multi-pronged pain management plan after knee and hip replacement. We reviewed the scientific research on pain management to improve recovery following surgery. We did this to provide evidence-based information with respect to this pain management. The scientific papers we chose were taken from several electronic databases. We found 27 articles that met our standards for being included in this review. Evidence in scientific literature shows that non-opioid pain treatments such as acetaminophen, NSAIDs, COX-2 inhibitors, gabapentinoids, ketamine, peripheral nerve blocks, and local anesthesia benefit patients after knee and hip replacement. However, further quality research trials are needed to be more sure. In conclusion, certain scientific research papers support the use of non-opioid treatments as part of a multi-pronged pain medication plan for effective pain management after knee and hip replacement.",2,C
73,34232932,"Multimodal analgesia has become the standard of care for total joint arthroplasty as it provides superior analgesia with fewer side effects than opioid-only protocols. Systemic medications, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen, corticosteroids, and gabapentinoids, and local anesthetics via local infiltration analgesia and peripheral nerve blocks, are the foundation of multimodal analgesia in total joint arthroplasty. Ideally, multimodal analgesia should begin preoperatively and continue throughout the perioperative period and beyond discharge. There is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of intravenous acetaminophen or liposomal bupivacaine as part of multimodal analgesia protocols.","Using several types of pain treatment at once has become the standard way to care for patients having joint replacement surgery.

73,33204789,"Background: Opioid addiction is endemic in the United States. We developed a standardized opioid-prescribing schedule (SOPS) after total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and evaluated opioid usage alongside Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) pain interference scores. We hypothesized that opioid usage would be less than prescribed and reducing prescription would decrease consumption without negatively impacting the PROMIS scores. Methods: A prospective observational study was performed on all patients undergoing primary THA and TKA from April 7, 2018, to August 10, 2019. Opioid consumption and pain interference were determined 2 weeks after discharge via telephone and email surveys. SOPSs were implemented during the study. Outcomes were compared in patients before and after the SOPS. Results: A total of 715 patients met inclusion criteria; 201 patients completed surveys. Before the SOPS, the mean opioid prescription was 81.2 ± 15.3 tablets for THA and 82.9 ± 10.6 for TKA. The mean usage was 35.1 ± 29.4 tablets and 35.4 ± 33.4, respectively. After the SOPS, the mean usage decreased to 19.4 ± 16.8 (P = .04) and 31.6 ± 20.9 (P = .52), respectively. After implementation of a second SOPS for THA, the mean number of tablets consumed was 21.5 ± 18.6 (P = .05 compared with pre-SOPS). The PROMIS 6B responses in patients who underwent THA demonstrated no significant changes. PROMIS 6B responses for TKA showed an increase in interference with recreational activities (P = .04) and tasks away from home (P = .04), but otherwise had no significant impact on reported scores. Conclusions: Implementation of the SOPS reduced postoperative opioid prescription and consumption without significantly impacting the reported pain interference, supporting the need to decrease opioid prescription after THA and TKA.","Opioid addiction is commonplace in the United States. We created a standard for prescribing opioids to treat pain after hip and knee replacement. We also studied opioid usage alongside a system of measuring pain as reported by patients. We assumed that people would use opioids less than prescribed. We also assumed that reducing prescriptions of opioids would reduce the amount taken without increasing the amount of pain reported. This study followed patients over time, without intervening. It was done on all patients that had hip and knee replacement from April 7, 2018, to August 10, 2019. We determined the amount of opioids used and how pain interfered with patients’ lives 2 weeks after discharge using telephone and email surveys. Standards for prescribing opioids were used during the study. Outcomes were compared in patients before and after following these standards. A total of 715 patients were able to be in the study. Of those, 201 patients completed surveys. Before the standards were followed, the average opioid prescription was about 81 tablets for hip replacement and about 83 tablets for knee replacement. The average number of tablets used for both hip replacement and knee replacement was 35. After the standards were followed, the average number of tables taken dropped to about 19 for hip replacement and about 32 for knee replacement. After following a second standard for hip replacement, the average number of tablets taken was about 22. There was not a significant changed in pain reported by patients that had hip replacement. For knee replacement, there was an increase in patient-reported interference with recreational activities and tasks away from home, but otherwise there was no significant impact. We conclude that following our standards for prescribing opioids reduced the amount of opioids both prescribed and taken, without significantly impacting the reported pain interference. This supports the need to decrease opioid prescription after hip and knee replacement surgery.",2,C
73,30562208,"There are multiple available agents and modalities for controlling pain perioperatively during total joint arthroplasty to improve the patient experience, and their unique mechanisms and applications should be considered for use preoperatively, intraoperatively, and postoperatively, keeping in mind that each has differing efficacy and side-effect profiles. Preoperative pain control or preemptive analgesia using anti-inflammatory drugs and opioid analgesics appears to be effective in reducing postoperative pain, although the recommended timing and type of agents are unclear. With regard to intraoperative anesthetic choice and pain control, spinal anesthesia appears to have fewer systemic risks than general anesthesia, and periarticular injections of local anesthetic agents, regardless of technique, and with or without the addition of sympathetic modulators, opioids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or corticosteroids, have been shown to improve pain scores postoperatively and to overall carry a low risk profile. When considering postoperative pain control, there are several modalities including cryotherapy, peripheral nerve blockade, and parenteral and enteral medication options including acetaminophen, cyclooxygenase inhibitors, neuromodulators, tramadol, ketamine, and opioid patches, but there is no clearly preferred medication regimen and individual patient risk profiles must be considered when choosing appropriate pain management agents. Multimodal pain management can decrease opioid usage, improve pain scores, increase patient satisfaction, and enhance early recovery. The ideal preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative pain medication regimen remains unclear, and an individualized approach to perioperative pain management is recommended. Despite this, good results are demonstrated with the existing variations in pain management protocols in the literature. Treatment of severe postoperative pain in a multimodal fashion carries the risk for serious side effects, including respiratory depression, mental status changes influencing safe gait mechanics, hypotension, renal and hepatic dysfunction, hematologic variations, gastrointestinal considerations including gastric ulcers, constipation or ileus, nausea or vomiting, infection at injection sites, and peripheral nerve injury with peripheral blockade.","There are many options to control pain during joint replacement surgery to improve the patient experience. Doctors should consider the unique ways that each of these options works when using them before, during, and after surgery. Doctors should also keep in mind that each has different efficacy and side-effects. Pain control before surgery or using anti-inflammatory drugs and opioid painkillers before the pain starts seems to work well to reduce pain after surgery. However, it is not clear what the recommended timing and type of treatment are. Regarding the choice of anesthetic during surgery and pain control, anesthesia applied directly to the spine seems to have fewer general risks to the body than general anesthesia. In addition, injections of local anesthetics around the joint, regardless of technique, have been shown to improve pain scores following surgery and to have low risk overall. This is true whether the injections are used with or without adding other drugs, including those that control the body’s fight-or-flight response, opioids, NSAIDs or corticosteroids. When considering pain control following surgery, there are several methods. These include cold therapy, disabling nerves with injection or electrical stimulation, and medicines take by mouth or otherwise. Options for medicines include Tylenol®, COX inhibitors, drugs that affect the brain, tramadol (sold as Ultram or Zytram), ketamine, and opioid patches. However, there is no clearly preferred treatment, and doctors need to consider individual risks faced by patients when choosing appropriate pain treatments. Using multiple pain treatments at once can decrease opioid usage, improve pain scores, increase patient satisfaction, and enhance early recovery. It is still not clear what the ideal medication plan to use before, during, and after surgery is. We recommend using an individualized approach to pain management around the time of surgery. In spite of this, changes to existing ways of treating pain in the scientific literature have shown good results. Using a multi-pronged approach to treat severe pain following surgery has the risk for serious side effects. These including slow or shallow breathing, changes in mental state that can affect walking, low blood pressure, kidney and liver problems, blood problems, stomach problems, including ulcers, constipation or bowel obstruction. Possible side effects also include nausea or vomiting, infection at injection sites, and nerve injury if nerves are disabled (peripheral blockade).",2,C

Seventy-one percent of the patients had concomitant superior laryngeal nerve or recurrent laryngeal nerve motor neuropathy documented by laryngeal electromyography or videostroboscopy. After a negative workup for reflux, asthma, or postnasal drip, these patients were treated with gabapentin at 100 to 900 mg/d. Symptomatic relief was achieved in 68% of the patients.

Treatment outcome was defined by improvement or resolution of symptoms on a self-reported outcome scale. Results: Of 12 patients identified, 75% exhibited evidence of motor neuropathy on laryngoscopy and 83% had symptoms related to chronic cough treated with neuromodulator therapy over a mean follow-up of 20.4 months. The median dose of amitriptyline hydrochloride was 25 mg daily, and that of gabapentin was 300 mg 3 times daily. The mean time from the initiation of therapy to a complete response was 2 months. Conclusions: Patients with suspected neuropathy of the recurrent laryngeal nerve frequently respond to neuromodulator therapy. The addition of reflux precautions and acid suppression therapy is helpful in cases of chronic and recurrent laryngospasm. Patients with evidence of motor neuropathy appear to have better outcomes with neuromodulator therapy.","Researchers studied ways to treat patients with upper respiratory tract symptoms due to disorder of a nerve supplying sensation (sensory neuropathy) to the throat-the recurrent laryngeal nerve.

The patients were followed to see if their symptoms improved after starting a neuromodulator (a drug that has an effect on nerves). Patients were asked if the drug improved their symptoms. In 12 patients, tests showed 75% had motor neuropathy (disorder of the nerves controlling the muscles) of the throat. Also, 83% had chronic cough treated with a neuromodulator. They were followed for about 20 months. Two neuromodulator drugs were used in the study, amitriptyline hydrochloride (about 25 mg a day) and gabapentin (about 300 mg three times a day). It took about 2 months for complete symptom improvement after the drugs were first started. These neuromodulator drugs often help the symptoms if doctors suspect neuropathy of the recurrent laryngeal nerve as the cause.

74, ,"The most important causes of cough were: cough variant asthma (CVA) (n = 41, 33.3%), rhinitis and/or sinusitis (n = 30, 24.4%), gastroesophageal reflux (GERC) (n = 25, 20.3%), medicine related (n = 7, 5.7%), eosinophilic bronchitis (EB) (n = 6, 4.9%), atopic (n = 4, 3.3%), and idiopathic (n = 6, 4.9%). Other causes included pulmonary interstitial fibrosis (n = 2, 1.6%), left heart insufficiency (n = 1, 0.8%) and bronchiectasis (n = 1, 0.8%). There was more nocturnal cough in CVA (80.9%, 36/41) than in other causes (chi2 = 19.81, P<0.01). In CVA, 63.4% (26/41) was complicated with atopic rhinitis, 68.3% (28/41) showed seasonal variations, and 67.8% (19/28) aggravated in the autumn. GERC manifested more day coughs, with 56.0% (14/25) cough associated with taking food and 68.0% (17/25) with reflux symptoms. There was more productive cough in rhinitis and/or sinusitis (73.3% (22/30) ,chi2 = 24.99, P<0.01). The percentages of CVA and GERC were significantly higher than those reported in Guangzhou (chi2 value were 9.52 and 4.56 respectively, P<0.01), but those of EB and atopic cough were significantly lower (p values were 17.61 and 7.86 respectively, P<0.01). Conclusions: The most common causes of chronic cough in our study were CVA, rhinitis and/or sinusitis, GERC, medicine related cough, EB and atopic cough, which were different from previous reports in other cities such as Guangzhou. The spectrum and clinical features of causes for chronic cough are important in the diagnostic procedure of chronic cough.","The most important causes of chronic cough were (most to least): cough variant asthma (CVA), inflammation of the nose (rhinitis) and/or sinuses (sinusitis), gastroesophageal reflux (GERC), medicine related, inflammation of airways (eosinophilic bronchitis -EB), allergies, and unknown cause. Other lung and heart diseases caused chronic cough in a small number of patients Nighttime cough occurred the most in CVA than the other diseases. CVA was associated with nose allergy (atopic rhinitis) which changed with the seasons and increased in autumn. GERC was associated with daytime cough, cough with eating, and with reflux. Productive cough occurred more in rhinnitis and/or sinusitis. There were more patients with CVA and GERC in this study than in the study before in another city. But there were less patients with EB and allergic cough in this study. The most common causes of chronic cough in this study were CVA, rhinitis and/or sinusitis, GERC, medicine related, EB, and allergy related.

Methods: A total of 194 patients with at least 3 weeks of chronic cough and normal chest radiographs were recruited from the outpatient clinic of Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Diseases between July 2003 to June 2004. The causes were investigated using a well-established protocol. The diagnostic protocol included history inquiring and physical examination, pulmonary function tests, induced sputum cell differentials, 24 h esophageal pH monitoring, CT of the paranasal sinuses or chest, fiberoptic rhinoscopy or bronchoscopy. The final diagnosis was made based on clinical manifestation, examination findings and a positive response to therapy. Results: The cause of chronic cough was defined in 95.4% of the patients, with a single cause found in 153 patients (82.7%), and multiple causes in 32 patients (17.3%). The five most important causes of cough were: eosinophilic bronchitis (n = 51, 22.4%), rhinitis and/or paranasal sinusitis (PNDs, n = 39, 17.1%), cough-variant asthma (n = 31, 13.6%), atopic cough (n = 28, 12.3%), and gastroesophageal reflux (n = 27, 11.8%).

75,33072979,"Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a monogenetic disorder due to a single base-pair point mutation in the β-globin gene resulting in the substitution of the amino acid valine for glutamic acid in the β-globin chain. Phenotypic variation in the clinical presentation and disease outcome is a characteristic feature of the disorder. Understanding the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of the disorder is central to the choice of therapeutic development and intervention. In this special edition for newborn screening for haemoglobin disorders, it is pertinent to describe the genetic, pathologic and clinical presentation of sickle cell disease as a prelude to the justification for screening. Through a systematic review of the literature using search terms relating to SCD up till 2019, we identified relevant descriptive publications for inclusion. The scope of this review is mainly an overview of the clinical features of pain, the cardinal symptom in SCD, which present following the drop in foetal haemoglobin as young as five to six months after birth. The relative impact of haemolysis and small-vessel occlusive pathology remains controversial, a combination of features probably contribute to the different pathologies. We also provide an overview of emerging therapies in SCD.","Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder due to a single mutation in the Beta-globin gene. This mutation causes a change in an amino acid in the Beta-hemoglobin protein that decreases the ability of oxygen to be carried out to the body. Patients with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) may experience a variety of signs, symptoms and disease outcomes from this disorder. Understanding the causes, progression, and functional problems that result in patients with SCD are very important in finding and choosing treatments. In this special paper, doctors discuss the importance of screening newborns for SCD. They also describe the genes, the pathology, and the signs and symptoms of Sickle Cell Disease. This paper is the result of a very thorough research of the literature on SCD. The paper focuses on the pain SCD can cause after the decrease in fetal hemoglobin which occurs in infants as young as five to six months after birth. The features seen in Sickle Cell Disease is probably due to a combination of the red blood cells being destroyed and the small blood vessels being blocked. This paper also discusses new therapies for Sickle Cell Disease.",2,B
75,18695233,"Sickle cell disease (SCD) was the first human monogenic disorder to be characterized at the molecular level. It results from the substitution of glutamic acid by valine at position 6 of the β-chain of hemoglobin. The clinical manifestations of SCD arise from the tendency of sickle hemoglobin (known as HbS or α2βS2) to polymerize at reduced oxygen tensions and deform red cells into the characteristic rigid sickle cell shape. Such inflexible red cells cannot pass through the microcirculation efficiently, and this results in anemia (due to destruction of the red cells) and intermittent vasoocclusion causing tissue damage and pain. Although all patients with homozygous SCD have exactly the same molecular defect, there is considerable clinical variation, ranging from death in early childhood to a normal life span with few complications. Genetic modifiers of SCD include α-thalassemia, and it has been known for many years that patients with increased levels of fetal Hb (HbF or α2γ2) often tend to have a relatively mild clinical course because HbF reduces the tendency of HbS to polymerise within the red cell. Increased HbF may result from rare deletions within the β-globin gene cluster or from point mutations in the promoters of the fetal γ-globin genes (hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin, HPFH), but additional loci are known to increase HbF levels in adult life. Identifying such loci has been a painstaking task, but a combination of genome-wide analysis within a large kindred and within twin pairs has identified two quantitative trait loci (QTL) with major influences on fetal hemoglobin levels in adults. A significant proportion of the variation in HbF levels and the frequency of painful crises in patients with SCD is accounted for by five common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at these loci.","Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) was the first human genetic disorder caused by a mutation in a single gene to be described at the chemical level. SCD occurs when a mutation of the Beta-hemoglobin gene causes the amino acid, glutamic acid, to be replaced by valine in the beta chain of the hemoglobin protein. The signs and symptoms in SCD occur because these sickle hemoglobin (HbS) proteins tend to join together where oxygen levels are lower in the body. This causes the red blood cells to change into the typical abnormal rigid sickle cell shape. These rigid red blood cells cannot pass through the smallest blood vessels well.This causes the vessels to be blocked, resulting in tissue damage and pain.These sickle red blood cells are also destroyed, which causes anemia. Patients with the same genetic defect in SCD can have many different outcomes, ranging from death in early childhood to a normal life span with few problems. Alpha-Thalassemia is a genetic disease that can change the outcome of patients with SCD. Also, patients with increased levels of another type of hemoglobin protein, fetal hemoglobin (HbF), tend to have a milder disease. The presence of fetal hemoglobin decreases the tendency of the sickle hemoglobin to join together in the red blood cells. Increased levels of HbF may be due to other mutations in various hemoglobin genes. Identifying these mutations in the hemoglobin genes has been very difficult. But researchers have been able to identify two areas on the genes that have major influences on fetal hemoglobin (HbF) levels in adults. A large part of the different HbF levels and number of painful crises in Sickle Cell Disease patients is due to five common mutations in the hemoglobin gene.",2,B
75,18667698,"Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a debilitating monogenic blood disorder with a highly variable phenotype characterized by severe pain crises, acute clinical events, and early mortality. Interindividual variation in fetal hemoglobin (HbF) expression is a known and potentially heritable modifier of SCD severity. High HbF levels are correlated with reduced morbidity and mortality. Common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the BCL11A and HBS1L-MYB loci have been implicated previously in HbF level variation in nonanemic European populations. We recently demonstrated an association between a BCL11A SNP and HbF levels in one SCD cohort [Uda M, et al. (2008) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 105:1620-1625]. Here, we genotyped additional BCL11A SNPs, HBS1L-MYB SNPs, and an SNP upstream of (G)gamma-globin (HBG2; the XmnI polymorphism), in two independent SCD cohorts: the African American Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease (CSSCD) and an SCD cohort from Brazil. We studied the effect of these SNPs on HbF levels and on a measure of SCD-related morbidity (pain crisis rate). We strongly replicated the association between these SNPs and HbF level variation (in the CSSCD, P values range from 0.04 to 2 x 10(-42)). Together, common SNPs at the BCL11A, HBS1L-MYB, and beta-globin (HBB) loci account for >20% of the variation in HbF levels in SCD patients. We also have shown that HbF-associated SNPs associate with pain crisis rate in SCD patients. These results provide a clear example of inherited common sequence variants modifying the severity of a monogenic disease.","Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is a disabling genetic blood disorder caused by a single mutation. SCD can have various outcomes,but it can result in severe pain crises, acute symptoms, and early death. The severity of the problems that occur in SCD can vary depending on the amount of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) in the blood. High HbF levels are associated with decreased problems and death in patients with SCD. Common single mutations in two genes, BCL11A and HBS1L-MYB, are thought to cause the changes in HbF levels seen in European populations without anemia. Research has shown a connection between a single BCL11A gene mutation and HbF levels in some SCD patients. In this paper, researchers found more single mutations in the BCL11A, HBS1L-MYB, and HBC2 genes in two other groups of patients (a study in African Americans SCD patients and a study of SCD patients from Brazil). We studied the effect of these single gene mutations on HbF levels and the number of pain crises in SCD. We showed a strong connection between the single mutations in these genes and different HbF levels. Common single mutations in the BCL11A, HBS1L-MYB, beta-globin (HBB) genes explain >20% of the different HbF levels in SCD patients. These mutations, associated with HbF levels, are also associated with the number of pain crises in SCD patients. This shows a clear example that inherited common gene mutations can change the severity of a genetic disease. ",2,B
75,33216016,"Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is a disease characterized by abnormal red blood cell rheology. Because of their effects on HbS polymerization and red blood cell deformability, alpha-thalassemia and the residual HbF level are known genetic modifiers of the disease. The aim of our study was to determine if the number of HbF quantitative trait loci (QTL) would also favor a specific sub-phenotype of SCA as it is the case for alpha-thalassemia. Our results confirmed that alpha-thalassemia protected from cerebral vasculopathy but increased the risk for frequent painful vaso-occlusive crises. We also showed that more HbF-QTL may provide an additional and specific protection against cerebral vasculopathy but only for children with alpha-thalassemia (-α/αα or -α/-α genotypes).","Sickle Cell Anemia (SCA) is a genetic blood disease that causes abnormal red blood cell flow through blood vessels.

Results showed that alpha-thalassemia protected SCA patients from cerebral vasculopathy (diseases of blood vessels in the brain). But, it increased the risk for more painful crises due to blood vessel blockages. We also showed that more HbF-QTL may protect more against cerebral vasculopathy, but only for children with certain genetic types of alpha-thalassemia.",2,B

Genotyping of BCL11A (rs1886868 C/T), HBS1L-MYB (rs9389268 A/G) and Xmn1 γG158 (rs7842144 C/T) SNPs showed no statistically significant difference between SCD patients and controls except for the hetero-mutant genotypes of BCL11A which was significantly higher in SCD patients compared with controls. Baseline HbF levels were significantly higher in those with co-inheritance of polymorphic genotypes of BCL11A + HSB1L-MYB and BCL11A + Xmn1. Steady-state HbF levels, used as an indicator of disease severity, were significantly higher in SCD-Sβ patients having the polymorphic genotypes of HSB1L-MYB. Fold change of HbF in both patient groups did not differ between those harboring the wild and the polymorphic genotypes of the studied SNPs. In conclusion, BCL11A, HSB1L, and Xmn1 genetic polymorphisms had no positive impact on baseline HbF levels solely but had if coexisted. Discovery of the molecular mechanisms controlling HbF production could provide a more effective strategy for HbF induction.","Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is a genetic blood disease that can affect many areas of the body. The course of the disease can vary between patients. Different levels of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) is a main reason that explains the variation in the course of SCD.

Our research focused on specific areas in these genes that affected HbF and also affected the disease severity in SCD patients in Egypt. The study compared 2 groups, 100 SCD patients and 100 patients without SCD (controls). Generally, closer analysis of the BCL11A, HBS1L-MYB, and Xmn1 genes didn't show important differences between the 2 groups. But certain specific genetic mutations in the BCL11A gene were higher in SCD patients. Baseline HbF levels were significantly higher in those who inherited mutations of both BCL11A + HSB1L-MYB and BCL11A+ Xmn1 genes. Steady HbF levels, (a sign of disease severity) in both groups, were significantly higher in SCD-Sbeta patients having the different genetic mutations of the HSB1L-MYB gene. The protein folding chemistry of HbF in both groups didn’t change between patients with the normal or mutant genes. BCL11A, HSB1L, and Xmn1 gene mutations did not have a positive effect on baseline HbF levels unless the mutations occurred together.

75,32447424,"Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) ameliorates clinical severity of sickle cell anemia (SCA). The major loci regulating HbF levels are HBB cluster, BCL11A, and HMIP-2 (HBS1L-MYB). However, the impact of noncoding single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in these loci on clinical outcomes and their functional role on regulating HbF levels should be better elucidated. Therefore, we performed comprehensive association analyses of 14 noncoding SNPs in five loci with HbF levels and with clinical outcomes in a cohort of 250 children with SCA from Southeastern Brazil, and further performed functional annotation of these SNPs. We found SNPs independently associated with HbF levels: rs4671393 in BCL11A (β-coefficient = 0.28), rs9399137 in HMIP-2A (β-coefficient = 0.16), and rs4895441 in HMIP-2B (β-coefficient = 0.15).

Patients who had minor mutations (carriers) that increased HbF levels (HbF-boosting) had reduced white blood cells counts. Carriers of other minor mutations (genetic differences) showed higher levels of oxygen in the blood. Patients carrying still other minor genetic differences in BCL11A showed lower risk of transfusions. These findings were separate from the HbF effect. Carriers of other minor mutations showed lower risk of acute chest syndrome. Carriers of the standard minor genetic change showed lower risk of infection.

Procedure: Steady-state biological parameters and vaso-occlusive crises (VOC) requiring emergency admission were recorded over a 2-year period in 301 children with SCA. The age of the first hospitalized VOC was also recorded. These data were correlated with the alpha-globin and HbF-QTL genotypes. For the latter, three different genetic loci were studied (XmnI, rs7482144; BCL11A, rs1427407; and the HBS1L-MYB region, rs28384513) and a composite score was calculated, ranging from zero (none of these three polymorphisms) to six (all three polymorphisms at the homozygous state). Results: A positive clinical impact of the HbF-QTL score on VOC rate, HbF, leucocytes, and C-reactive protein levels was observed only for patients without alpha-thalassemia deletion. Conversely, combination of homozygous -3.7 kb deletion with three to six HbF-QTL was associated with a higher VOC rate. The age of the first hospitalized VOC was delayed for patients with one or two alpha-thalassemia deletions and at least two HbF-QTL. Conclusion: Alpha-thalassemia -3.7 kb deletion and HbF-QTL are modulating factors of SCA clinical severity that interact with each other. They should be studied and interpreted together and not separately, at least in HU-free children.","Researchers analyzed the effects of an alpha-thalassemia (another genetic blood disease) mutation and fetal hemoglobin-promoting quantitative trait loci (HbF-QTL (special section of DNA)) in Senegalese children and young adults with Sickle Cell Anemia (SCA) who have not received the medicine, hydroxyurea. Steady biological signs and crises from blood vessel blockages (vaso-occlusive crises-VOC) requiring emergency admission were recorded over a 2-year period in 301 children with Sickle Cell Anemia (SCA). The age of the first hospitalized VOC was also recorded. These facts were compared to patients who had alpha-globin and HbF-QTL genes. Three different gene regions on the HbF-QTL gene were studied in detail. A score was given to patients from zero to six depending on the different changes (mutations) at the 3 gene regions. A higher HbF-QTL score resulted in better signs of SCA disease outcome only for patients without the alpha-thalassemia mutation. With the alpha-thalassemia mutation, a higher HbF-QTL score was linked to more VOC (vaso-occlusive crises). The age of the first hospitalization for VOC was older in patients with the alpha-thalassemia mutation and at least 2 HbF-QTL gene region mutations. The alpha-thalassemia mutation and the HbF-QTL gene mutations react with each other and can change the severity of Sickle Cell Anemia.

75,30216683,"Introduction: Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) is the major modifier for sickle cell disease (SCD) severity. HbF is modulated mainly by three major quantitative trait loci (QTL) on chromosomes 2, 6, and 11. Methods: Five SNPs in the three QTLs (HBG2, rs7482144; BCL11A, rs1427407 and rs10189857; and HBS1L-MYB intergenic region, rs28384513 and rs9399137) were investigated by multiplex PCR and reverse hybridization, and their roles in HbF and clinical phenotype variability in Iraqi Kurds with SCD were assessed. Results: HBG2 rs7482144 with minor allele frequency (MAF) of 0.133 was the most significant contributor to HbF variability, contributing 18.1%, followed by rs1427407 (MAF of 0.266) and rs9399137 (MAF of 0.137) at 14.3% and 8.8%, respectively. The other two SNPs were not significant contributors. Furthermore, when the cumulative numbers of minor alleles in the three contributing SNPs were assessed, HbF% and hemoglobin concentration increased with increasing number of minor alleles (P < 0.0005 and 0.001, respectively), while serum lactic dehydrogenase, reticulocytes, leukocytes, transfusion, and pain frequencies decreased (P = 0.003, 0.004, <0.0005, <0.0005, and 0.017, respectively). Conclusions: It was demonstrated that SNPs in all three major HbF QTLs contribute significantly to HbF and clinical variability in Iraqi Kurds with SCD and that the cumulative number of minor alleles at contributing SNPs may serve as a better predictor of such variability in this population.","Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) is an important protein that affects the severity of Sickle Cell Disease (SCD).

The roles of these mutations in HbF were studied. The research evaluated how these mutations affected the variety of characteristics seen in Iraqui Kurds with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD).  Three minor single mutations of the HBG2 gene resulted in the most important changes in HbF. The other two single mutations did not contribute significantly. An increase in the number of these minor single mutations resulted in an increase in the amount of HbF and hemoglobin. This also resulted in a decrease in blood lactic dehydrogenase (an enzyme from tissue damage), white blood cells, transfusions, and occurences of pain. Research showed these mutations in all three major HbF QTLs are important to HbF. These mutations also contribute to the variety of disease outcomes in Iraqui Kurds with SCD.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the biological impact of α genes, β haplotypes, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) activity at baseline and with hydroxyurea (HU). Homozygous HbS patients from the Créteil pediatric cohort with available α-gene and β-haplotype data were included (n = 580; 301 females and 279 males) in this retrospective study. Homozygous β-haplotype patients represented 74% of cases (37.4% CAR/CAR, 24.3% BEN/BEN, and 12.1% SEN/SEN). HU was given to 168 cohort SCA children. Hematological parameters were recorded when HbF was maximal, and changes (ΔHU-T0) were calculated. At baseline, CAR-haplotype and α-gene numbers were independently and negatively correlated with Hb and positively correlated with lactate dehydrogenase. HbF was negatively correlated with CAR-haplotype numbers and positively with BEN- and SEN-haplotype numbers. The BCL11A/rs1427407 ""T"" allele, which is favorable for HbF expression, was positively correlated with BEN- and negatively correlated with CAR-haplotype numbers. With HU treatment, Δ and HbF values were positively correlated with the BEN-haplotype number. BEN/BEN patients had higher HbF and Hb levels than CAR/CAR and SEN/SEN patients. In conclusion, we show that BEN/BEN patients have the best response on HU and suggest that this could be related to the higher prevalence of the favorable BCL11A/rs1427407/T/allele for HbF expression in these patients.","Sickle Cell Anemia (SCA) is caused by a single gene mutation.

This research studies the importance of alpha genes, different beta gene types, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD-an enzyme that protects red blood cells from damage) activity in patients before and after treatment with the medicine, hydroxyurea. This study included boys and girls who inherited the sickle hemoglobin (HbS) from both parents (SS -Creteil pediatric group). Facts about the alpha-gene and beta-globin genetic types were known. Children who inherited the major different beta-globin genetic types from both parents made up 74% all patients CAR/CAR, BEN/BEN, and SEN/SEN. Hydroxyurea (HU) was given to 168 children with Sickle Cell Anemia (SCA). Factors in the blood were recorded when HbF was highest. Changes were analyzed after hydroxyurea (HU) was given. Before HU, the CAR beta-globin genetic type and the alpha-gene were separately linked to lower hemoglobin and higher lactate dehydrogenase (an enzyme from tissue damage). Higher HbF was linked to lower CAR genetic type numbers but higher BEN and SEN genetic type numbers. A BCL11A gene mutation is linked to the favorable higher HbF levels. This gene mutation was also linked to higher BEN, but lower CAR genetic type numbers. With HU treatment, positive changes and higher HbF numbers were linked to the BEN genetic type. BEN/BEN patients had higher HbF and hemoglobin (Hb) levelsthan CAR/CAR and SEN/SEN patients. This research shows that children inheriting BEN mutations from both parents (BEN/BEN) have the best response on hydroxyurea. This could be related to the more likely presence of favorable genetic mutations for HbF production in these patients.",2,B
75,29205277,"We aimed to investigate the clinical and genetic predictors of painful vaso-occlusive crises (VOC) in sickle cell disease (SCD) in Cameroon. Socio-demographics, clinical variables/events and haematological indices were acquired. Genotyping was performed for 40 variants in 17 pain-related genes, three fetal haemoglobin (HbF)-promoting loci, two kidney dysfunctions-related genes, and HBA1/HBA2 genes. Statistical models using regression frameworks were performed in R® . A total of 436 hydoxycarbamide- and opioid-naïve patients were studied; median age was 16 years. Female sex, body mass index, Hb/HbF, blood transfusions, leucocytosis and consultation or hospitalisation rates significantly correlated with VOC. Three pain-related genes variants correlated with VOC (CACNA2D3-rs6777055, P = 0·025; DRD2-rs4274224, P = 0·037; KCNS1-rs734784, P = 0·01). Five pain-related genes variants correlated with hospitalisation/consultation rates. (COMT-rs6269, P = 0·027; FAAH-rs4141964, P = 0·003; OPRM1-rs1799971, P = 0·031; ADRB2-rs1042713; P < 0·001; UGT2B7-rs7438135, P = 0·037). The 3·7 kb HBA1/HBA2 deletion correlated with increased VOC (P = 0·002). HbF-promoting loci variants correlated with decreased hospitalisation (BCL11A-rs4671393, P = 0·026; HBS1L-MYB-rs28384513, P = 0·01). APOL1 G1/G2 correlated with increased hospitalisation (P = 0·048). This first study from Africa has provided evidence supporting possible development of genetic risk model for pain in SCD.","This research studies factors that may predict painful blood vessel blockages (VOC-vaso-occlusive crises) in Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) patients in Cameroon. Researchers found out facts about the population, signs and symptoms, and their blood. Genetic testing was done for 40 mutations in 17 pain-relating genes, three fetal hemoglobin areas on genes, two genes related to kidney disease, and the HBA1/HBA2 (alpha-globin)genes. Models were performed to predict outcomes. A total of 436 patients that had not taken hydroxycarbamide or opioids were studied. Half the patients were younger than 16 years old and half were older. Female sex, body mass index, Hb/HbF (hemoglobin/fetal hemoglobin), blood transfusions, higher white blood cell count, and consultations or hospitalisations are significantly linked with blood vessel blockages (vaso-occlusive crises (VOC)). Three pain-related gene variants (mutations) are linked to VOC. Five pain-related gene variants are linked to the amount of hospitalisations/consultations. These gene variants are specific mutations in COMT, FAAH, OPRM1, ADRB2, and UGT2B7 genes. A specific mutation in the HBA1/HBA2 genes are linked to increased VOC. Specific gene variants on the BCL11A gene and the HBS1L-MYB gene increase HbF and are linked to decreased hospitalisation. The APOL1 G1/G2 genes (related to kidney disease) are linked to increased hospitalisation. This first study from an African country has provided evidence supporting the possible development of a genetic risk model for pain in Sickle Cell Disease. ",2,B
