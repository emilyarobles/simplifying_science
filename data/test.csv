5,30377698,"Purpose: Osteoarthritis of the knee is a common disease, often associated with a Baker's cyst.  Besides osteoarthritis, also other joint pathologies of the knee can be causative for a Baker's cyst.  Radiotherapy is known to be an effective treatment for osteoarthritis, with an anti-inflammatory effect.  As the excessive production of synovia usually is associated with intraarticular inflammation, our hypothesis was that radiotherapy might positively influence the synovial production and reduce the volume of a Baker's cyst.  Materials and methods: We performed a prospective trial, including 20 knees receiving radiotherapy for knee arthritis.  Besides documentation of NRS (numeric rating scale), WOMAC (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) score and Knee Society Score, the volume of the Baker's cyst was calculated for a short- (6 to 12 weeks) and long-term (9 to 12 months) follow-up.  Ultrasonic volumetry was performed using an ultrasound device with a high-resolution multifrequency linear probe (6-9 MHz).  Results: Low-dose radiotherapy improved NRS, WOMAC score and Knee Society Score significantly.  The mean volume of Baker's cyst decreased from 22.3 ml to 10.7 respectively 3.1 ml during follow-up.  A decrease in volume of more than 25% compared to the baseline could be achieved for 75% of the patients in the short-term and 79% of the patients in the long-term follow up.  Conclusion: Radiotherapy of knee osteoarthritis is an effective treatment that decreases the volume of a Baker's cyst.  Most patients respond to the treatment.  Whether radiotherapy is an effective treatment for Baker's cyst without associated osteoarthritis has to be further examined.","Knee osteoarthritis is a common disease, often occuring with Baker's cyst (a fluid-filled pocket behind the knee). Besides osteoarthritis, other knee joint diseases can lead to an uncomfortable fuild-filled swelling behind the knee. Radiation therapy treats osteoarthritis, with an anti-inflammatory effect. As excess fluid in joints is linked with joint inflammation, radiation therapy may help fluid production in joints and reduce the size of the fluid-filled swelling behind the knee. Our trial includes 29 knees receiving radiation therapy for knee arthritis. Besides knee pain and function measurements, the size of the cust was measured for a short- (6 to 12 weeks) and long-term (9 to 12 months) follow-up. Low-dose radiation therapy improves measurements for knee arthritis. The size of the fluid-filled swelling behind the knees decreased. 75% of patients in the short-term and 79% of patients in the long-term achieved a decrease in size of over 25% relative to baseline scores. Radiation therapy of knee osteoarthritis decreases the size of a Baker's cyst. Most patients respond to the treatment. Whether radiation therapy treats Baker's cyst without associated osteoarthritis is unknown.",2,C

So we asked if radiotherapy may reduce both the production of synovia and volume of Baker's cyst. To answer this question, we performed a prospective trial, where we examined 20 knees receiving radiotherapy for knee arthritis. We assigned scores for the degree of osteoarthitis and calculated the cyst volume for a short- (6 to 12 weeks) and long-term (9 to 12 months) follow-up. We measured cyst volume by ultrasound, and found that low-dose radiotherapy improved knee osteoarthritis scores significantly. The average volume of Baker's cysts also decreased from 22.3 ml to 10.7 respectively during follow-up. A decrease in cyst volume of more than 25% compared to the starting volume could be achieved for 75% of the patients in the short-term, and 79% of the patients in the long-term follow up.

5,32631287,"Background: This study aimed to compare the arthroscopic internal drainage of popliteal cysts alone or in combination with cyst wall resection in terms of clinical outcomes.  Methods: Forty-two consecutive patients with symptomatic popliteal cysts received arthroscopic treatment.  Specifically, 20 of them received arthroscopic internal drainage (AI group) alone and 22 received arthroscopic internal drainage combined with cyst wall resection (AICR group) through double posteromedial portals.  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed to identify recurrence of popliteal cysts.  The Lysholm score and Rauschning-Lindgren grade were used to assess the clinical outcomes.  The median of the follow-up period was 24 months (12-48 months). Results: The two groups (AI group and AICR group) were similar in age, gender, cyst diameter, associated joint disorder, preoperative Lysholm score, preoperative Rauschning-Lindgren grade and follow-up period (P > 0.05).  Relative to the AI group, the AICR group had a significantly prolonged operation time (P < 0.05) and a higher incidence of complications (P < 0.05).  In both groups, the Rauschning-Lindgren grade at the last follow-up significantly differed from the preoperative grade (P < 0.05) and the Lysholm knee score remarkably increased compared to the preoperative score (P < 0.05); however, there were no differences between the two groups at the last follow-up (P > 0.05).  According to the MRI results, the cyst disappeared in 11 (55%), shrank in size in 6 (30%) and existed in 3 (15%) patients in the AI group, and was absent in 18 (81.8%) and shrank in size in 4 (18.2%) patients in the AICR group, suggesting a significant difference between the two (P < 0.05).

We identified reappearance of fluid-filled cysts with medical imaging. We also took knee-specific clinical measurements. The average follow-up period was 24 months. The two treatment groups were similar in age, gender, cyst diameter, associated joint disorder, initial clinical scores, and follow-up period. Relative to the internal joint drainage alone group, the internal joint drainage with cyst wall removal surgery group had increased operation time and more difficulties. In both groups, cyst scores at the last follow-up differed from the starting score. The knee scores improved compared to starting scores; however, the two groups did not differ at the last follow-up. According to imaging results, the fluid-filled swelling disappeared in 11 (55%), shrank in 6 (30%), and existed in 3 (15%) patients of the internal joint drainage alone group. The cyst was absent in 18 (81.8%) and shrank in 4 (18.2%) patients of the internal joint dranage with cyst wall removal surgery group, implying a difference between the two groups. Additional cyst wall removal surgery can lower reappearance rate of cysts (fluid-filled pockets) but increase operation time and surgery complications compared with internal joint drainage of cysts alone.",2,C

5,30884939,"Popliteal cyst is a common peri-knee cyst, also known as a Baker's cyst. With the current development of popliteal cysts, the pathogenesis is mainly due to increased pressure in the knee joint caused by various reasons, leading to a fluid-filled sac that can form behind the knee as a result of enlargement of the gastrocnemius-semimembranosus bursa. The current diagnostic methods include X-ray computed, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance. Among them, magnetic resonance imaging is considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of popliteal cysts. There are various treatments, including conservative treatment, traditional surgical resection and arthroscopic surgery. In recent years, the focus of the treatment of popliteal cysts has gradually shifted from the simple removal of cysts to arthroscopic treatment of intra-articular lesions and the treatment of joint-cyst communication, and achieved a good effect. However, there are still controversies about the most effective treatment, and the best surgery method is still uncertained. It is hoped that high quality prospective studies will be able to directly compare different surgery methods, so as to select the best treatment for popliteal cyst. This article reviews past literature research and describes in detail the epidemiology, pathological mechanism, clinical manifestations and signs, auxiliary examination, diagnosis and differential diagnosis and clinical treatment of popliteal cysts. Different diagnosis methods and treatment methods are compared and summarized to provide basis for clinical diagnosis and treatment.","Popliteal cyst, also known as Baker's cyst, occurs in the knee region. Popliteal cysts are caused by increased pressure on the knee joint which results in the abnormal enlargement of a bursa (protective fluid-filled sac) behind the knee to form a cyst. Orthopedic specialists can diagnose popliteal cysts using X-ray computed tomography (CT scan), ultrasound, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI is the gold standard for diagnosis of popliteal cysts Treatment options for popliteal cysts include conservative treatment, traditional surgery, and arthroscopic surgery.

5,26137182,"Context: Popliteal synovial cysts, also known as Baker's cysts, are commonly found in association with intra-articular knee disorders, such as osteoarthritis and meniscus tears. Histologically, the cyst walls resemble synovial tissue with fibrosis evident, and there may be chronic nonspecific inflammation present. Osteocartilaginous loose bodies may also be found within the cyst, even if they are not seen in the knee joint. Baker's cysts can be a source of posterior knee pain that persists despite surgical treatment of the intra-articular lesion, and they are routinely discovered on magnetic resonance imaging scans of the symptomatic knee. Symptoms related to a popliteal cyst origin are infrequent and may be related to size. Conclusion: A capsular opening to the semimembranosus-medial head gastrocnemius bursa is a commonly found normal anatomic variant. It is thought that this can lead to the formation of a popliteal cyst in the presence of chronic knee effusions as a result of intra-articular pathology. Management of symptomatic popliteal cysts is conservative. The intra-articular pathology should be first addressed by arthroscopy. If surgical excision later becomes necessary, a limited posteromedial approach is often employed. Other treatments, such as arthroscopic debridement and closure of the valvular mechanism, are not well studied and cannot yet be recommended."," Popliteal synovial cysts, also known as Baker's cysts, commonly occur in association with intra-articular knee disorders, such as osteoarthritis and meniscus tears.

Osteocartilaginous loose bodies may occur within the cyst, even if they are not seen in the knee joint. Baker's cysts can cause posterior knee pain that persists despite surgical treatment of the intra-articular lesion, and they routinely appear on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the symptomatic knee. Symptoms related to a popliteal cyst origin occur infrequently and may depend on the size of the cyst A common normal variant of knee synovial tissue shows a capsule-shaped opening to the semimembranosus-medial head gastrocnemius bursa ( a fluid-filled sac that lies between semimembranosus muscle and superficial muscle in the back part of the lower leg .) This variant may lead to the formation of a popliteal cyst due to chronic leakage of synovial fluid caused by intra-articular tissue damage . Management of symptomatic popliteal cysts is conservative. An orthopedic specialist should first use arthroscopy to examine the intra-articular tissue damage . If surgical removal of the cyst later becomes necessary, the surgeon may use a limited posteromedial approach , where an incision is made in the middle inner side of the knee.

Removal of the cyst (cystectomy) is performed by an extra-articular surgical approach, where a small hole is made in the side of the knee above the knee joint (a high posteromedial portal). We included twenty-one patients diagnosed with symptomatic popliteal cysts who had unsuccesful previous conservative treatments in our study. At a median follow-up time of 29.4 months, all knees had improved clinical function assessed by Rauschning and Lindgren knee classification criteria scores. The cysts had either disappeared (95.2%) or reduced in size (4.8%). Only one (4.8%) patient had a recurrent cyst, which was removed by ultrasound-guided aspiration. This direct extra-articular arthroscopic technique could be a feasible alternative treatment for symptomatic popliteal cysts.",2,C

12,26854761,"Purpose of review: This article presents recent findings and perspectives on the relationship between early-life respiratory infections and asthma inception, and discusses emerging concepts on strategies that target these infectious agents for asthma prevention. Recent findings: Cumulative evidence supports the role of early-life viral infections, especially respiratory syncytial virus and human rhinovirus, as major antecedents of childhood asthma. These viruses may have different mechanistic roles in the pathogenesis of asthma. The airway microbiome and virus-bacteria interactions in early life have emerged as additional determinants of childhood asthma. Innovative strategies for the prevention of these early-life infections, or for attenuation of acute infection severity, are being investigated and may identify effective strategies for the primary and secondary prevention of childhood asthma. Summary: Early-life infections are major determinants of asthma development. The pathway from early-life infections to asthma is the result of complex interactions between the specific type of the virus, genetic, and environmental factors. Novel intervention strategies that target these infectious agents have been investigated in proof-of-concepts trials, and further study is necessary to determine their capacity for asthma prevention.","This article describes the relationship between early-life respiratory infections (infections in the lungs that impact breathing and occur in the first few years of life) and how asthma begins. The article also discusses new strategies to prevent asthma by stopping these infections. Viruses that occur in early life, especially respiratory syncytial virus (a contagious virus that infects the lungs and airway tubes) and human rhinovirus (the common cold), usually occur before asthma starts. These viruses may have different roles in how asthma develops. How airway microbiome (micro-organisms such as bacteria in the lungs) interact with bacteria from viruses may determine that a child will develop asthma. New strategies for preventing these infections that occur early in life, or for weakening the symptoms of infections, are being investigated and may help prevent childhood asthma. In summary, early-life infections are major factors of asthma development. How these early-life infections lead to asthma is from the reactions between the virus, genes, and the environment. New treatment and therapy strategies that target these infections have been researched, and more studies are needed to see if they will help prevent asthma.",1,C

12,26277597,"Lower respiratory tract infections by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are the foremost cause of infant hospitalization and are implicated in lasting pulmonary impairment and the development of asthma. Neutrophils infiltrate the airways of pediatric patients with RSV-induced bronchiolitis in vast numbers: approximately 80% of infiltrated cells are neutrophils. However, why neutrophils are recruited to the site of viral respiratory tract infection is not clear. In this review we discuss the beneficial and pathologic contributions of neutrophils to the immune response against RSV infection. Neutrophils can limit viral replication and spread, as well as stimulate an effective antiviral adaptive immune response. However, low specificity of neutrophil antimicrobial armaments allows for collateral tissue damage. Neutrophil-induced injury to the airways during the delicate period of infant lung development has lasting adverse consequences for pulmonary architecture and might promote the onset of asthma in susceptible subjects. We suggest that pharmacologic modulation of neutrophils should be explored as a viable future therapy for severe RSV-induced bronchiolitis and thereby prevent the inception of subsequent asthma. The antiviral functions of neutrophils suggest that targeting of neutrophils in patients with RSV-induced bronchiolitis is best performed under the umbrella of antiviral treatment.","Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a contagious virus that infects the lungs and airway tubes and can lead to lower respiratory tract infections (infection in the airways). These infections are a common reason for infant hospital stays, long-term lung problems, and the development of asthma, a long-term condition that affects the tubes that carry air in and out of the lungs and makes it hard to breathe. Many neutrophils (white blood cells that fight infection) enter the airways of children with bronchiolitis (a common lung infection in children and infants) caused by RSV. However, why neutrophils are sent to the site of lung infection is not clear. This review discusses how neutrophils help the immune system respond to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections. Neutrophils can limit how the virus spreads and can activate the immune system to fight the virus. Sometimes neutrophils that are fighting infection can lead to tissue damage. Neutrophils that cause injury to airways when an infant's lungs are being developed have a long-term impact on lung function and may lead to asthma. Medications that can change neutrophils may be explored as a possible therapy for bronchiolitis caused by RSV and prevent the development of asthma. For patients with bronchiolitis caused by RSV, it is best to use a general antiviral medication when also using neutrophils to help fight infection.",1,C

Bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) may be improved with steroid (man-made drugs with a synthetic hormone) and non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (drugs that relieve pain) and with maritime climatotherapy, where a patient is relocated to a different location close to the sea for health reasons. Maritime climatotherapy may improve BHR by reducing the level of irritants inhaled from the air. How maritime climatic cures work are discussed. Metereological (weather) events such as cold weather fronts have shown a negative impact on how asthma disease progresses.

Researchers use multiple ways to examine the immunome in 20 volunteers at baseline (the start of the study), and again after intravenous (medication delivered through the vein) hydrocortisone (steroid medication) given at moderate and low doses. A thorough review of cell characteristics of lymphocytes subsets (parts of a type of white blood cell that is part of the immune system) saw a decline in B cell subsets that work with substances found in body fluids and in T-cell subsets that focus on specific foreign substances after receiving hydrocortisone. However, B and T cells rebounded or increased above baseline 24 hours after receiving hydrocortisone, while natural killer cell numbers (white blood cells that kill cells infected with a virus) remained stable. Additional analysis found several results: less responsive signaling from NF-κB (proteins involved in different cell functions including immunity responses), apoptosis (normal cell death), and cell death signaling that comes before changes in lymphocytes amount, with activation of signaling in natural killer cells and glucocorticoid receptors (receptors that regulates genes controlling development, metabolism, and immune response). This study is the first to methodically describe the effects of corticosteroids on the human immunome and showed that hydrocortisone has different effects on B and T lymphocytes and natural killer cells in humans.

16,1139040,"Lymphocyte kinetic studies employing 51-chromium-labeled autologous lymphocytes were performed in nine normal volunteers in order to determine the effects of hydrocortisone administration on the recirculating versus the nonrecirculating intravascular lymphocyte pools. Following infusion of labeled cells, the recirculating portion of the labeled cells rapidly equilibrated with the total intravascular lymphocyte pool and the vastly larger total-body recirculating lymphocyte pool, so that by 1 hr following infusion 21.8% plus or minus 3.2% of the labeled lymphocytes were left in the circulation. Four hundred milligrams of intravenous hydrocortisone administered 24 hr after infusion of labeled cells caused a profound but transient lymphocytopenia which was maximal at 4 hr with return of lymphocyte counts to normal by 24 hr after injection. Concomitant with the lymphocytopenia there was a dramatic increase in lymphocyte specific activity (cpm per 10-6 lymphocytes), while the total lymphocyte-associated radioactivity remaining in the circulation was unchanged, indicating that corticosteroid administration depleted the unlabeled recirculating cells. As the lymphocyte counts returned to normal following hydrocortisone, the specific activity also returned to normal. These studies indicated that hydrocortisone administration caused a transient lymphocytopenia by a preferential depletion of the recirculating portion of the intravascular lymphocyte pool.","Studies on lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell that is part of the immune system) that are taken from people and returned to the same individuals is performed on nine healthy volunteers to determine the effects of hydrocortisone (a steroid medication used to help calm the immune system) on the lymphocyte pools in blood. The recirculating or re-added part of the new lymphocyte cells returned to volunteers quickly balanced with the total lymphocyte pools and by 1 hour after the cells were put in the body, 21.8% were left in circulation. Hydrocortisone is provided to the volunteers through the vein 24 hours after the infusion of cells. It caused a major but short-term lymphocytopenia (a lower-than-normal number of lymphocytes in the blood) at 4 hours and then lymphocytes returned to normal levels by 24 hours after the injection. Naturally occurring with lymphocytopenia was a big increase in lymphocyte (white blood cell) specific activity, while the total lymphocyte radioactivity (release of energy) in the circulation did not change, suggesting that corticosteroid administration reduced the recirculating cells that were not provided to the volunteers. The lymphocyte counts (white blood cell count) returned to normal after hydrocortisone use. The specific activity also returned to normal. These studies suggest that giving hydrocortisone caused a short-term lymphocytopenia by reducing the recirculating portion of the lymphocyte pool in the blood.",1,B
16,1078546,"The mechanisms and kinetics of the immunosuppressive effects of alternate-day prednisone were investigated in a group of patients with a variety of inflammatory diseases receiving a range of alternate-day prednisone doses from 5 to 120 mg. Total circulating lymphocyte and monocyte counts, as well as proportions of lymphocyte subpopulations defined both by surface markers and by in vitro functional capacities, were studied. At 8 a. m. of the day on prednisone, just before drug administration, lymphocyte and monocyte counts, proportions of lymphocyte subpopulations, as well as in vitro lymphocyte blastogenic responses to various mitogenic and antigenic stimuli were normal. 4 h after the administration of prednisone, there was a profound lymphocytopenia and monocytopenia, with a differential depletion of thymus-derived lymphocytes as well as various functionally defined lymphocyte subpopulations. Lymphocyte kinetic studies using a radioactive chromium-labeled autologous lymphocytes showed that the lymphocytopenia was due predominantly to a transient depletion of the recirculating portion of the intravascular lymphocytepool. All these parameters returned to normal by 8 a.m. of the following day (off prednisone) and remained normal throughout the day. This very transient lymphocytopenia and monocytopenia after prednisone, with normal cell numbers, proportions, and functions throughout the remainder of the 2-day cycle, was associated with suppression of disease activity, yet did not affect cutaneous delayed hypersensitivity in these patients nor increase the likelihood of infectious complications. This drug-associated cyclic and transient monocytopenia and selective lymphocytopenia is best explained by a redistribution of recirculating lymphocytes to other body compartments, particularly the bone marrow.","The process and reactions of the immune system from taking alternate- or every-other-day prednisone (a type of steroid drug that works by lowering the activity of the immune system) are investigated in a group of patients with different inflammatory diseases (diseases in which the immune system attacks the body's own tissues). Total circulating lymphocyte (the total number of white blood cells in body fluids) and number of monocytes (an immune cell that attacks and breaks down germs and bacteria that enter the body), as well as lymphocyte subpopulations (parts of lymphocytes or white blood cells), were studied. At 8 a.m. of the day of receiving prednisone, just before the drug was given to patients, blood tests that include lymphocyte and monocyte counts and proportions of lymphocyte subpopulations were found to be normal. Four hours after receiving the prednisone, there is major lymphocytopenia (a condition where there is a lower-than-normal number of lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell, in the blood), monocytopenia (a reduction of monocytes, a type of immune cell, in the blood), reduction of T-cells (a type of immune cell that help protect the body from infection), and the presence of different lymphocyte subpopulations. Studies that focus on lymphocyte reactions showed that lymphocytopenia is due to short-term reduction of white blood cells circulating within and outside cells. All these blood measures returned to normal by 8 a.m. the next day (off the prednisone) and stayed normal throughout the day. The very short-term lymphocytopenia and monocytopenia after prednisone, with normal cell numbers and counts for the rest of the 2-day cycle, are connected with eliminating disease activity, yet did not affect cutaneous delayed hypersensitivity (showing a reaction in the skin after several days) and did not increase the chance of complications with infection. The short-term monocytopenia and lymphocytopenia connected with this drug is best explained as the body redistributing lymphocytes (white blood cells that are part of the immune system) to other parts of the body, particularly the bone marrow.",1,B
16,2199128,"The growth of knowledge in the field of the pharmacokinetics of prednisolone/prednisone has been slow for several reasons. First, convenient and specific methods for measuring these steroids only became available with the development of high performance liquid chromatographic methods. Secondly, prednisolone is nonlinearly bound to transcortin and albumin: since the unbound concentrations of prednisolone are biologically relevant, it was necessary to determine the free fraction in each plasma sample. Thirdly, due to the short half-life of prednisolone no steady-state is achieved, and therefore area under the concentration-time curve needed to be determined in all studies. Fourthly, prednisolone and prednisone are interconvertible and prednisolone is given intravenously as an ester prodrug, features which created controversies about the correct interpretation of pharmacokinetic results. Finally, the total body clearances of total and (to a lesser degree) of unbound prednisolone increase with increasing concentrations of prednisolone. Therefore, in order to compare pharmacokinetic results between different subjects, standardised doses had to be administered. The investigations performed so far have revealed that: (1) the dose-dependent pharmacokinetics partly explain the clinical observation that an alternate-day regimen with prednisone yields fewer biological effects; (2) the interconversion of prednisone into prednisolone is not a limiting factor, even in patients with severely impaired liver function; (3) hypoproteinaemia per se does not cause increased unbound concentrations of prednisolone in vivo; (4) patients with liver failure, renal failure or a renal transplant, subjects older than 65 years, women on estrogen-containing oral contraceptive steroids or subjects taking ketoconazole have increased unbound concentrations of prednisolone-whereas hyperthyroid patients, some patients with Crohn's disease, subjects taking microsomal liver enzyme-inducing agents or patients on intravenous prednisolone phthalate (instead of prednisolone phosphate) or on some brands of enteric coated prednisolone tablets have decreased concentrations of prednisolone. The biological relevance of the altered pharmacokinetics is supported in part by altered clinical effects and altered effects on cellular immunofunctions.","The growth of knowledge in the field of pharmacokinetics (how the body handles a drug) of prednisolone/prednisone (two types of steroid drugs) has been slow for several reasons. First, the most convenient and specific way to measure these steroid drugs only became possible with the development of high performance liquid chromatographic methods, a technique that separates, identifies, and counts different parts in a mixture that makes it easy to analyze. Secondly, it is necessary to understand the free fraction, or portion of the drug that has an effect on the body, of prednisolone in each plasma (the liquid portion of blood) sample. Third, due to the short half-life (how long it takes for a drug concentration to be reduced to exactly half its initial amount in the blood) of prednisolone, there is no steady state (when how much the body is given of prednisolone is equal to how much of the drug the body eliminates). Therefore, the area under the concentration-time curve (a measure of total exposure to the drug in the body's systems) is needed. Fourth, prednisolone and prednisone can be exchanged for one another or converted to the other, and prednisolone is given intravenously or via injection. These features create disagreement about the correct way to understand how the body is able to handle these drugs. Finally, the total amount of prednisolone that is cleared from the body and the total amount of prednisolone that has an effect on the body increase with more concentration of prednisolone. Therefore, in order to compare pharmacokinetic results (how the body responds to or handles a drug) between different people, the same dose has to be given to patients. The investigations done so far reveal that: 1) using the amount of dose to understand the body's effect explains why an alternate- or every-other-day treatment with prednisone leads to fewer effects in the body; 2) it is not a limiting factor that prednisone can convert to prednisolone; 3) hypoproteinaemia (lower than normal levels of protein in the body) does not cause an increase of the amount of drug in the body that can have an effect; 4) patients with liver failure, kidney failure, or kidney transplant, as well as people with other conditions, have an increased amount of the prednisolone drugs - while patients with other conditions such as Crohn's disease have decreased amounts of prednisolone. The biological importance of the changes in how the body handles these steroids is supported, in part, by changes at the clinical and immune cell level.",1,B

First, convenient and specific methods to measure these steroids only became available with the creation of advanced lab techniques. Secondly, prednisolone is connected to certain liver proteins. Since the unconnected amounts of prednisolone are important, it was necessary to measure the unconnected amount in each blood sample. Thirdly, due to the short span of prednisolone, no balance is achieved. Thus, specific measurements needed to always be measured. Fourthly, prednisolone and prednisone are interchangeable and prednisolone is given into the blood in an inactive form, attributes which created issues about correct interpretation of the lab results. Finally, the full-body removal of total and unconnected prednisolone increase with increasing amounts of prednisolone. Therefore, to compare lab results between different patients, measured doses had to be given. The tests performed have shown that (1) the dose-dependent drug reactions partly explain observations that an every-other-day schedule with prednisone leads to less biological effects. (2) The change of prednisone into prednisolone is not limiting, even in patients with very damaged liver function. (3) Subnormal protein levels do not cause increased amounts of unbound prednisolone in living beings. (4) Patients with liver failure, kidney failure or a kideny transplant, subjects older than 65 years, women on estrogen-containing, pregnancy-preventing, oral steroids or subjects taking ketoconazole (an antifungal medication) have increased amounts of unbound prednisolone.

16,7310640,"Six healthy male volunteers were given 5, 20, and 50 mg of oral prednisone and 5, 20, and 400 mg doses of intravenous prednisolone. Plasma and urine concentrations of prednisone and prednisolone were determined by HPLC, and the binding of prednisolone to plasma proteins was measured by radioisotopic and equilibrium dialysis techniques. The pharmacokinetics of both oral prednisone and intravenous prednisolone were dose-dependent. The mean oral dose plasma clearances of prednisone ranged from 572 ml/min/1.73 m 2 for the 5 mg dose to 2271 ml/min/1.73 m 2 for the 50 mg dose. Changes in prednisone half-life were insignificant, but increases in the half-life of its metabolite were dose-dependent. The systemic plasma clearance of i.v. prednisolone was dose-dependent and increased from 111 to 194 ml/min/1.73 m 2 over the 5 to 40 mg i.v. dosage range. The steady-state volume of distribution also increased, but little change in mean transit time and half-life was found. The binding of prednisolone to plasma proteins was markedly concentration-dependent, and a two compartment, nonlinear equation was used to characterize the effective binding of prednisolone to transcortin and albumin. The apparent pharmacokinetic parameters of protein-free and transcortin-free prednisolone were relatively constant with dose. The interconversion of prednisone and prednisolone varied with time and dose, although prednisolone concentrations dominated by 4- to 10-fold over prednisone. In urine, 2-5% of either administered drug was excreted as prednisone and 11-24% as prednisolone. The apparent renal clearances of both steroids were also nonlinear and unrelated to protein binding. These studies indicate that the pharmacokinetics of prednisone and prednisolone are dose-dependent and that protein binding does not fully explain their apparent nonlinear distribution and disposition.","Six healthy male volunteers were given 5, 20, and 50 mg of oral prednisone (steroid medication given by mouth) and 5, 20, and 400 mg doses of intravenous, or IV, prednisolone (steroid medication delivered through the vein).

How prednisolone attaches to proteins in plasma are also measured. The pharmacokinetics (how the body handles a drug) of both oral prednisone and IV prednisolone are dose-dependent (in which the effects of a drug change when the dose of the drug is changed). There are major changes in prednisone half-life (how long it takes for a drug concentration to be reduced to exactly half its initial amount in the blood), but increases in the half-life of its chemical changes by the body are dose-dependent. How the body clears IV prednisolone from plasma is dose-dependent. The steady-state volume (when how much the body is given of prednisolone is equal to how much of the drug the body eliminates) also increased, but little change in the average time and half-life is found. The binding of prednisolone to plasma proteins was primarily based on the concentration or amount of the drug. The pharmacokinetic measures of prednisolone not attached to proteins or transcortin-free (free of a protein from the liver) are mostly constant with the dose provided. How prednisone and prednisolone can be exchanged for one another or converted to the other varies with time and dose, although the amount of prednisolone is greater than the amount of prednisone. The observed renal (kidney-related) elimination or removal of both steroid drugs are also nonlinear (increases in drug exposure are not directly related to increases in given doses) and unrelated to protein attachment. These studies suggest that how the body handles prednisone and prednisolone are dose-dependent and that attaching to proteins does not fully explain their apparent nonlinear distribution and how it is absorbed and excreted in the body.",1,B
16,23444285,"In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), nocturnal release of proinflammatory cytokines is not adequately counteracted by endogenous glucocorticoid and is associated with symptoms of morning stiffness and pain. Taking exogenous glucocorticoid during the night reduces morning stiffness significantly more than treatment at the conventional time in the morning, although waking to take tablets is unacceptable for patients. Modified-release prednisone tablets were developed to allow administration at bedtime for programmed delivery of glucocorticoid during the night. Single-center crossover studies were conducted, each in ≤24 healthy subjects, to compare the pharmacokinetics of a single 5-mg oral dose of modified-release prednisone and conventional prednisone, as well as the effect of food on bioavailability. There was no substantial difference in pharmacokinetic parameters of the formulations apart from the programmed delay in release of glucocorticoid from the modified-release tablets (C(max) 97%, AUC(0-∞) 101%, 90% confidence intervals within the requisite range for bioequivalence). Administration after a full or light meal did not affect pharmacokinetic characteristics, but bioavailability was reduced under fasted conditions. Pharmacokinetic evaluation in 9 patients with RA confirmed that modified-release prednisone tablets taken at bedtime (around 22:00 h) with or after an evening meal result in programmed release of glucocorticoid 4 to 6 hours after intake.","In rheumatoid arthritis (when the body's immune system attacks its own tissue, including joints, by mistake), nighttime release of proinflammatory cytokines (a type of molecule from immune cells that is capable of creating inflammation) is not prevented well by endogenous glucocorticoid (a type of steroid hormones produced within the body such as in tissues) and is connected with symptoms of morning stiffness and pain. Taking exogenous or external glucocorticoid during the night reduces morning stiffness significantly more than treatment at the usual time in the morning, although waking to take tablets is unacceptable for patients. Modified-release prednisone tablets are developed to allow it to be taken at bedtime for programmed or scheduled delivery of glucocorticoid during the night.

There is no great difference in pharmacokinetic measures of the doses besides the programmed delay in release of glucocorticoid from the modified-release tablets. Taking the drug after a full or light meal did not affect pharmacokinetic characteristics, but how much of the drug that was circulating or floating in the body is reduced under fasted conditions (on an empty stomach or before the first meal of the day). Evaluating the effect of the drug in 9 patients with rheumatoid arthritis confirmed that modified-release (delayed release) prednisone tablets taken at bedtime with or after an evening meal results in programmed release of glucocorticoid 4 to 6 hours after taking the tablets.",1,B
16,15257071,"Background: Renal transplant recipients were noted to appear cushingoid while on low doses of steroid as part of a triple therapy immunosuppression of cyclosporin A (CsA), prednisolone, and azathioprine. Methods: The study group comprised adult renal transplant recipients with stable graft function who had received their renal allograft a minimum of 1 year previously (43 studies undertaken in 22 men and 20 women) with median daily prednisone dose of 7 mg (range 3-10). The control group was healthy nontransplant subjects [median dose 10 mg (10-30)]. Prednisolone bioavailability was measured using a limited 6-hour area under the curve (AUC), with prednisolone measured using specific HPLC assay. Results: The median prednisolone AUC/mg dose for all transplant recipients was significantly greater than the control group by approximately 50% (316 nmol x h/L/mg prednisolone versus 218). AUC was significantly higher in female recipients (median 415 versus 297 for men) and in recipients receiving cyclosporin (348 versus 285). The highest AUC was in women on estrogen supplements who were receiving cyclosporin (median 595). A significantly higher proportion of patients on triple therapy had steroid side effects compared with those on steroid and azathioprine (17/27 versus 4/15), more women than men had side effects (14/16 versus 7/22), and the AUC/mg prednisone was greater in those with side effects than without (median 377 versus 288 nmol x h/L/mg). Discussion: The results are consistent with the hypothesis that CsA increases the bioavailability of prednisolone, most likely through inhibition of P-glycoprotein. The increased exposure to steroid increased the side-effect profile of steroids in the majority of patients. Because the major contributor to AUC is the maximum postdose concentration, it may be possible to use single-point monitoring (2 hours postdose) for routine clinical studies.","People who received a renal (kidney) transplant appear cushingoid (having different symptoms, often facial puffiness and weight gain, due to too much of the hormone cortisol in the body) while on low doses of steroid as part of multiple drug treatments, including prednisolone. The study group has adult kidney transplant patients with stable functions within the transplanted kidney who got the kidney at least a year ago along with an average daily prednisone dose of 7 mg. The comparison group is healthy people who did not receive a transplant. Prednisolone bioavailability (how much of a drug becomes completely available to the intended part of the body) is measured using an area under the curve (a measure of total exposure to the drug in the body's systems), with prednisolone measured using HPLC, or high performance liquid chromatographic (a technique that separates, identifies, and counts different parts in a mixture that makes it easy to analyze). The prednisolone area under the curve for all transplant patients is significantly greater than the comparison group of healthy non-transplant patients. Area under the curve measurements are much higher in females patients and in patients receiving cyclosporin, a drug that prevents the body from rejecting a transplant. The highest area under the curve measurement is in women on estrogen supplements (pills taken, often to resolve symptoms related to menopause) who are taking cyclosporin. A significantly higher proportion of patients on multiple-drug therapy had steroid side effects compared with those on steroid and azathioprine (a drug that can prevent organ rejection after a transplant). More women than men had side effects, and the area under the curve prednisone was greater in those with side effects than without. The results are consistent with the suggestion that cyclosporin A increases the bioavailability (how much of a drug becomes completely available to the intended part of the body) of prednisolone.

16,6445384,"The effects of single oral doses of 10, 15, or 30 mg of prednisone on circulating mononuclear cells, autologous MLR, mitogen responses, and allogeneic MLR were studied in healthy volunteers. Doses as low as 10 mg were immunosuppressive, causing diminution of circulating T cells and monocytes, and significant reduction in autologous but not allogeneic MLR responses. These effects were maximal 6 hr after drug administration and gone by 24 hr. Autologous MLR responses were particularly sensitive to the effects of prednisone being significantly and consistently suppressed 2 hr after drug administration, before significant cell redistribution had occurred. Macrophage-enriched stimulating cells were more easily suppressed than responding T cells. Since the autologous MLR may be important in in vivo regulation of immune responses, its reduction by low-dose glucocorticoids may be of clinical relevance. This suppressive effect must be considered in studies of the autologous MLR in patients receiving glucocorticoid therapy.","The effects of single oral (by mouth) doses of prednisone (a type of man-made steroid drug that can help lower certain immune-related symptoms, including inflammation and swelling) on circulating mononuclear cells (major cells in the body that signal the immune system), autologous mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) (the availability of non T-cells to stimulate T-cells), mitogen responses (to help measure immune response), and allogeneic MLR (grouping of white blood cells called lymphocytes from unrelated individuals resulting in T cell activation) are studied in healthy volunteers. Low doses were immunosuppressive (drugs or medicines that lower the body's ability to reject a transplanted organ), causing reduced circulation and amounts of T-cells (a type of immune cell that help protect the body from infection) and monocytes (an immune cell that attacks and breaks down germs and bacteria that enter the body), and major losses in autologous but not allogeneic MLR responses. The maximum effect occurred 6 hours after the drug is provided, and effects are gone by 24 hours. Autologous MLR responses are very sensitive to the effects of prednisone and were significantly and consistently slowed or stopped 2 hours after the drug was provided. Macrophage-enriched stimulating cells (a type of white blood cell that surrounds and kills foreign organisms like bacteria and activates other immune system cells) were more easily slowed than responding T cells. Because autologous MLR may be important in in vivo (experiments within a living human or animal) monitoring of immune responses, its reduction by low dose glucocorticoids (medicines that fight inflammation and work with your immune system) may be important. This suppressive (slowing down) effect must be considered in studies of the autologous MLR in patients receiving glucocorticoid drugs.",1,B
16,11753760,"The aim of this study was to estimate the influence of corticosteroids on Th1 and Th2 serum cytokine balance in patients with GO: IFNgamma, TNFalpha, IL-4 and IL-10. Further, we tested the hypothesis of an up-regulation of Th2 immune response during successful treatment with corticosteroids to explain their beneficial effect in Graves' ophthalmopathy. Serum cytokines were detected in three groups of subjects: 20 patients with Graves' disease without ophthalmopathy (Gd), 16 patients with clinical symptoms of ophthalmopathy (GO) (CAS over 3 points, last consultation record for GO less than a year old) and 16 healthy volunteers. Corticosteroid therapy consisted of intravenous infusions of methylprednisolone (MP) (2 series, 3 g each time) and subsequent treatment with oral prednisone (60 mg per day) in a tapering schedule. The serum samples were collected 24 hours before MP, 24 hours after MP, 14 days of treatment with prednisone and at the end of corticosteroid therapy. The levels of IFNgamma, TNFalpha, IL-4 and IL-10 in the serum were determined using ELISA. Statistical significance was estimated by the Mann-Whitney U-test. Our findings show a deviation to systemic Th2 profile cytokines in Graves' disease. In patients with GO, we found a significantly increased serum IL-10 concentration. In corticosteroid-responsive patients, the balance of serum cytokines IL-4/IFNgamma, IL-4/TNFalpha, IL-10/IFNgamma and IL-10/TN Falpha increased and remained upregulated until the end of the study. In non-responders, the balance of serum cytokines studied increased after methylprednisolone but declined markedly during continuation of the therapy with prednisone. In summary, our results show that efficient corticosteroid therapy may be related to its influence on Th2/Th1 profile cytokine balance. The upregulation of serum IL-4 and IL-10 during successful treatment with corticosteroids indicate the possibility of using these cytokines as predictors of the beneficial effect of corticosteroids in Graves' ophthalmopathy.","The aim of this study is to estimate the effect of corticosteroids (anti-inflammatory drugs that help relieve pain and swelling, also known as steroids) on blood level balance of Th1-related (cells that activate cellular immune responses) and Th2-related (cells that activate hormonal immune responses) cytokines (chemical messengers that coordinate the immune response) in patients with Graves' ophthalmopathy (swelling of the tissue in the area around the eyes). Further, researchers tested the theory of an up-regulation of the Th2 immune response (where Th2 cells increase their responses to a signal from outside the cell to carry out specific functions) during successful treatment with corticosteroids. Chemical messengers in the blood called cytokines are detected in 3 groups of study participants: 20 patients with Graves' disease without ophthalmology, 16 patients with clinical symptoms of Graves' ophthalmology, and 16 healthy volunteers. Corticosteroid therapy consisted of intravenous (IV) infusions (medication delivered through the vein) of methylprednisolone (a steroid drug) and followed by treatment with oral or by-mouth prednisone (a steroid drug) in a gradually decreasing schedule. Blood samples are collected before and after methylprednisolone, 14 days of treatment with prednisone (a type of steroid drug that can help lower certain immune-related symptoms, including inflammation and swelling), and at the end of the corticosteroid therapy.  The findings show a shift in the response of Th2 cytokines in Graves' disease. In patients with Graves' ophthalmology, there is a significantly increased blood concentration of Interleukin 10 or IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine which helps minimize damage to the body caused by the immune's response. In patients that received corticosteroids and had a response from the drug, the balance of certain blood cytokines that were measured had increased and remained increased until the end of the study. In those patients who did not respond to the corticosteroids, the balance of the specific blood cytokines studied had increased after receiving methylprednisolone but declined a great deal as the therapy continued with prednisone. In summary, results show that effective corticosteroid therapy may be related to its influence on Th2/Th1 cytokine profile balance. The upregulation or increase of blood IL-4 and IL-10 during successful treatment with corticosteroids suggests the possibility of using these cytokines to help predict the beneficial effect of corticosteroids in Graves' ophthalmopathy.",1,B

We studied the effect of a five day course of prednisone (1 mg/kg body weight per day) on MPS function in 10 healthy volunteers, using soluble radiolabeled aggregates of human immunoglobulin G as a probe. MPS function was assessed before steroid treatment, and again 24 hours after the last dose of prednisone. Elimination kinetics and the uptake of the immunoglobulin aggregates by liver and spleen did not change after prednisone treatment. This suggests that, in contrast to general belief, high doses of glucocorticosteroids have no direct, acute effect on MPS function.","It is though that glucocorticosteroids (strong medicines that fight inflammation and work with the immune system) disrupt the elimination of immune complexes (build-up in the blood that can cause infection and problems with the immune system) by the mononuclear phagocyte system (a family of cells that fight foreign substances and are part of the immune system). Researchers studied the effect of a five day course of prednisone (a type of steroid drug that can help lower certain immune-related symptoms, including inflammation and swelling) on how the mononuclear phagocyte system functions in 10 healthy volunteers using soluble (can be dissolved in water) build-up of human immunoglobulin G (an common antibody in the body that protects against infection) as a tool to monitor. The mononuclear phagocyte system function is assessed before giving the steroid treatment and again 24 hours after the last dose of prednisone. The elimination reaction and the use of the immunoglobulin by the liver and spleen did not change after prednisone treatment.

On the basis of the data collected, the CT images were reviewed again to evaluate the characteristics (size, number, distribution, and morphology) of pulmonary cysts. Results: Lower lung-predominant cysts were more likely to be found in patients with BHD syndrome than in patients with LAM or in the NBNL DCLD group. In the axial distribution, 18 of 33 patients in BHD group had cysts that were predominantly near the mediastinum, and all the patients in the LAM and NBNL DCLD groups had diffuse cysts. The appearance of fusiform cysts was more easily observed in patients in the BHD group.

22,26877139,"Loss-of-function mutations in the folliculin gene (FLCN) on chromosome 17p cause Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome (BHD), which is associated with cystic lung disease. The risk of lung collapse (pneumothorax) in BHD patients is 50-fold higher than in the general population. The cystic lung disease in BHD is distinctive because the cysts tend to be basilar, subpleural and lentiform, differentiating BHD from most other cystic lung diseases. Recently, major advances in elucidating the primary functions of the folliculin protein have been made, including roles in mTOR and AMPK signaling via the interaction of FLCN with FNIP1/2, and cell-cell adhesion via the physical interaction of FLCN with plakophilin 4 (PKP4), an armadillo-repeat containing protein that interacts with E-cadherin and is a component of the adherens junctions. In addition, in just the last three years, the pulmonary impact of FLCN deficiency has been examined for the first time. In mouse models, evidence has emerged that AMPK signaling and cell-cell adhesion are involved in alveolar enlargement. In addition, the pathologic features of human BHD cysts have been recently comprehensively characterized. The ""stretch hypothesis"" proposes that cysts in BHD arise because of fundamental defects in cell-cell adhesion, leading to repeated respiration-induced physical stretch-induced stress and, over time, expansion of alveolar spaces particularly in regions of the lung with larger changes in alveolar volume and at weaker ""anchor points"" to the pleura. This hypothesis ties together many of the new data from cellular and mouse models of BHD and from the human pathologic studies. Critical questions remain. These include whether the consequences of stretch-induced cyst formation arise through a destructive/inflammatory program or a proliferative program (or both), whether cyst initiation involves a ""second hit"" genetic event inactivating the remaining wild-type copy of FLCN (as is known to occur in BHD-associated renal cell carcinomas), and whether cyst initiation involves exclusively the epithelial compartment versus an interaction between the epithelium and mesenchyme. Ultimately, understanding the mechanisms of cystic lung disease in BHD may help to elucidate the pathogenesis of primary spontaneous pneumothorax, with more than 20,000 cases reported annually in the United States alone.","Loss-of-function mutations in the folliculin gene, which helps suppress tumor growth, cause Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome, which is associated with cystic lung disease, a group of diseases that cause cysts (sacs of air) in the lungs. The risk of lung collapse, which is when air leaks into the space between the lung and chest wall, in Birt-Hogg-Dube patients is 50 times higher than in the general population. The cystic lung disease in Birt-Hogg-Dube is different from other cystic lung diseases because the cysts tend to be at the base of the lung, under the layer of tissue that wraps the lungs and is shaped like a lentil or lens. Recent advances to understand the main functions of the folliculin protein have been made. In addition, in just the last 3 years, the impact of a folliculin gene impairment on the lungs was examined for the first time. In experiments with mice, evidence emerged that another protein called AMPK that signals to other cells and cells connecting to other cells is involved when air gets trapped in the lungs. Also, how human Birt-Hogg-Dube cysts are formed and how they progress has been recently described. The ""stretch hypothesis"" proposes that cysts in Birt-Hogg-Dube form because of defects in how cells connect to one another, leading to repeated stretching of the lungs and, over time, expansion of different parts of the lung. This idea ties together many of the new data from cell and mouse studies of Birt-Hogg-Dube and from the human studies of the disease. Critical questions remain.

Reoccuring collapsing lungs are common. Early removal of the space between the lungs and chest wall is recommended. We need to better understand how FLCN affects lung cyst formation and how lung problems from BHD develop.",2,C

In China, patients with two negative (or undetected) viral tests for Covid-19 taken at least one day apart can be sent home with no further quarantine (isolation) required. Currently, testing of for coronavirus using a fecal or poop sample is not usually done. This paper describes a patient with Covid-19 whose tests from swabs of the back of the nose and throat were negative but fecal sample were positive for (or had) coronavirus, which causes Covid-19. The stool (feces) sample collected on 27th of February was still positive for genetic material of the coronavirus, 24 days after the first negative swab from the nose and throat. In conclusion, based on the experience from previous epidemics of lung infections, researchers recommend that testing fecal samples for coronavirus should be included into the standard for sending people home to decrease the risk of transmission (or spread) from the digestive system.",1,C

30,32840002,"Background: Nucleic acid persists after symptom resolution and infectivity for many viral infections via delayed clearance of nucleic acid fragments, non-infectious particles, or transmissible virus. For Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), the relationship between nasopharyngeal (NP) swab positivity, the development of antibodies against COVID-19, and clinical history are unclear. Study design and methods: Individuals who recovered from COVID-19 and volunteered to donate convalescent plasma (CP) were screened by NP swab PCR, responded to a questionnaire, and were tested for anti-COVID-19 antibodies. Results: A proportion of 11.8% of individuals tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by NP swab PCR greater than 14 days after the resolution of symptoms of active disease, including one donor who had asymptomatic disease and tested positive by NP swab 41 days after her initial diagnosis. Clinical history did not show a significant correlation with persistence of NP swab positivity. Also, NP swab positivity >14 days from symptom resolution did not correlate with anti-COVID-19 serology results. IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody strength correlated with hospitalization for COVID-19 using two different assays. Total anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antibody strength correlated with time from symptom resolution to sample collection and symptom duration. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid is detectable long after the resolution of symptoms in a significant percentage of previously diagnosed individuals, which is important to consider when interpreting PCR swab results. Persistence of PCR positivity does not correlate with antibody strength or symptoms of COVID-19. If anti-spike antibody is used to assess CP potency, individuals who suffered severe COVID-19 disease symptoms may represent better donors.","For many infections from viruses, traces of the infection can remain in the body after symptoms and transmission (or spread) to others stop. For Covid-19 (a viral, respiratory illness), the relationship between a positive (or virus-detected) nasal swab where a sample is taken from the back of the nose and throat, the development of antibodies (proteins in the body) that fight Covid-19, and the clinical history is unclear. In this study, people who recovered from Covid-19 and volunteered to donate plasma (the liquid part of blood) are screened for genetic material of the virus using a nasal swab. These volunteers also answer a series of questions and are tested for Covid-19 antibodies. There are 11.8% who tested positive for coronavirus, which causes COVID-19, using a nasal swab 14 days after symptoms stopped. Medical history does not show a big association with ongoing positive nasal swab tests. Also, a positive nasal swab >14 days after symptoms stop is not correlated with antibodies against Covid-19 in the plasma. A test measuring the increase of antibodies against Covid-19 relates with being in the hospital for Covid-19. Antibodies against Covid-19 corresponded with time after symptoms stopped to when the samples are collected and how long symptoms lasted. In conclusion, traces of genetic material from coronavirus can be found long after symptoms end in a significant percentage of people who have been diagnosed, which is important to remember when reading swab test results. Continuing to test positive does not correspond with antibody strength or symptoms of Covid-19. If measuring antibodies is used to understand plasma strength, individuals who have had serious Covid-19 disease symptoms may be better donors or donators.",1,C
30,32935877,"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) convalescent plasma (CCP) collection began in two Brazilian hospitals for treatment of severe/critical patients. Methods and materials: Mild/moderate COVID-19 convalescents were selected as CCP donors after reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and absence of symptoms for ≥14 days plus (a) age (18-60 years), body weight greater than 55 kg; (b) immunohematological studies; (c) no infectious markers of hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus, human T-lymphotropic virus-1/2, Chagas and syphilis infection; (d) no HLA antibodies (multiparous); (e) second RT-PCR (nasopharyngeal swab and/or blood) negativity; (f) virus neutralization test (cytopathic effect-based virus neutralization test neutralizing antibody) and anti-nucleocapsid protein SARS-CoV-2 IgM, IgG, and IgA enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Results: Among 271 donors (41 females, 230 males), 250 presented with neutralizing antibodies. Final RT-PCR was negative on swab (77.0%) or blood (88.4%; P = .46). Final definition of RT-PCR was only defined at more than 28 days after full recovery in 59 of 174 (33.9%) RT-PCR -ve, and 25/69 RT-PCR +ve (36.2%; 13 between 35 and 48 days). Neutralizing antibody titers of 160 or greater were found in 63.6%. Correlation between IgG signal/cutoff of 5.0 or greater and neutralizing antibody of 160 or greater was 82.4%. Combination of final RT-PCR -ve with neutralizing antibody ≥160 was 41.3% (112/271). Serial plasma collection showed decline in neutralizing antibody titers and IgA levels (P < .05), probably denoting a ""golden period"" for CCP collection (≤28 days after joining the program); IgA might have an important role as neutralizing antibody. Donor's weight, days between disease onset and serial plasma collection, and IgG and IgM levels are important predictors for neutralizing antibody titer. Conclusions: RT-PCR +ve cases are still detected in 36.2% within 28 to 48 days after recovery. High anti-nucleocapsid protein IgG levels may be used as a surrogate marker to neutralizing antibody.","Collection of blood plasma from people who have recovered from the viral, respiratory illness Covid-19, also called convalescent plasma, began in two hospitals in Brazil for treatment of severe patients. People recovering from mild or moderate Covid-19 infection are selected as donors for blood plasma if they have had no symptoms for at least 14 days. Additional tests are done for other infections such as hepatitis and HIV and for antibodies (or infection-fighting proteins) for Covid-19. Among 271 blood plasma donors, 250 have antibodies in the body to fight Covid-19. In 77% of donors, no genetic trace of Covid-19 is found from a swab test and in 88.4%, none is found in blood. At more than 28 days after full recovery, 59 out of 174 are negative (with no virus detected), and 25 out of 69 are positive (with virus detected), but 13 of these are between 35 and 48 days. Additional tests are done to learn more about the level of antibodies in the blood.  Blood plasma collection showed a decline in antibodies that attach to the virus and keep it from entering cells. The donor's weight, days between the start of the disease and repeated plasma collection, and antibody levels are important for predicting possible antibody concentration that can keep the virus from entering cells. In conclusion, a positive test that finds genetic traces of the virus are still detected in 36.2% of cases within 28 to 48 days after recovery. High levels of certain antibody proteins may be used to identify antibodies that can neutralize the virus and make it inactive.",1,C

Methods: We used generalised additive mixed models to analyse publicly available data from patients who received multiple RT-PCR tests and were identified as SARS-CoV-2 positive at least once. Results: The probability of a positive test decreased with time since symptom onset, with oropharyngeal (OP) samples less likely to yield a positive result than nasopharyngeal (NP) samples. The probability of incorrectly identifying an uninfected individual due to a false-negative test was considerably reduced if negative tests were repeated 24 hours later. For a small false-positive test probability (<0.5%), the true number of infected individuals was larger than the number of positive tests.

The chances of getting an incorrect positive (or virus-detected) result is low when using RT-PCR tests, but false negatives (when a person tests negative - not having the virus - but they are actually positive) are possible depending on swab type and time since symptoms started. The aim of this study is to determine how the likelihood of getting a false-negative test in patients with coronavirus is impacted by the time since symptoms started and the type of swab, a small piece of soft material sometimes on the end of a small stick. Publicly available data from patients who received several RT-PCR tests and identified as positive for coronavirus are analyzed. The likelihood of a positive test decreased with the time passed since the start of symptoms. Samples from the middle part of the throat are less likely to give a positive result than swabs from the throat and back of the nose. The chance of incorrectly identifying an uninfected person because of a false-negative is reduced if negative tests are repeated 24 hours later. For a small chance of a false-positive test (<0.5%), the true number of infected individuals is larger than the number of positive tests. For a higher chance of a false-positive test, the true number of infected individuals is smaller than the number of positive tests. In conclusion, the samples from the back of the nose called nasopharyngeal are more sensitive than the samples taken in the middle of the throat.

Our search found 12 reports, all of which described patients in China. Our review of these reports indicates the presence of discharged patients who remain asymptomatic but test positive. However, it is unclear whether they are contagious because a positive reverse transcriptase - polymerase chain reaction (RT- PCR) test does not necessarily indicate the presence of replicating and transmissible virus.

30,33113040,"Many studies have shown that re-positive tests for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR in recovered COVID-19 patients are very common. We aim to conduct this review to summarize the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of these patients and discuss the potential explanations for recurrences, the contagiousness of re-detectable positive SARS-CoV-2 virus, and the management of COVID-19 patients after discharge from hospital. The proportion of re-positive tests in discharged COVID-19 patients varied from 2.4 to 69.2% and persisted from 1 to 38 days after discharge, depending on population size, age of patients, and type of specimens. Currently, several causes of re-positive tests for SARS-CoV-2 in recovered COVID-19 patients are suggested, including false-negative, false-positive RT-PCR tests; reactivation; and re-infection with SARS-CoV-2, but the mechanism leading to these re-positive cases is still unclear. The prevention of re-positive testing in discharged patients is a fundamental measure to control the spread of the pandemic. In order to reduce the percentage of false-negative tests prior to discharge, we recommend performing more than two tests, according to the standard sampling and microbiological assay protocol. In addition, specimens should be collected from multiple body parts if possible, to identify SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA before discharge. Further studies should be conducted to develop novel assays that target a crucial region of the RNA genome in order to improve its sensitivity and specificity.","Many studies have shown that testing positive again for (or having) coronavirus in recovered Covid-19 patients (patients recovered from the serious viral, lung infection of Covid-19) is very common.

Preventing patients who have recovered and are sent home from testing positive again is an important step to control the spread of the pandemic. To limit the number of false-negatives tests (when a person tests negative but are actually positive for the virus) before being sent home, study researchers suggest doing more than 2 tests.

We aimed to describe positivity rate of SARS-CoV-2 assays employing three different measurement principles over a prolonged period. Two hundred sixty-eight samples from 180 symptomatic patients with COVID-19 and a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test followed by serological investigation of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were included. We conducted three chemiluminescence (including electrochemiluminescence assay (ECLIA)), four enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and one lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) test formats. Positivity rates, as well as positive (PPVs) and negative predictive values (NPVs), were calculated for each week after the first clinical presentation for COVID-19. Furthermore, combinations of tests were assessed within an orthogonal testing approach employing two independent assays and predictive values were calculated. Heat maps were constructed to graphically illustrate operational test characteristics. During a follow-up period of more than 9 weeks, chemiluminescence assays and one ELISA IgG test showed stable positivity rates after the third week. With the exception of ECLIA, the PPVs of the other chemiluminescence assays were ≥95% for COVID-19 only after the second week. ELISA and LFIA had somewhat lower PPVs. IgM exhibited insufficient predictive characteristics. An orthogonal testing approach provided PPVs ≥ 95% for patients with a moderate pretest probability (e.g., symptomatic patients), even for tests with a low single test performance. After the second week, NPVs of all but IgM assays were ≥95% for patients with low to moderate pretest probability. The confirmation of negative results using an orthogonal algorithm with another assay provided lower NPVs than the single assays. When interpreting results from SARS-CoV-2 tests, the pretest probability, time of blood draw, and assay characteristics must be carefully considered. An orthogonal testing approach increases the accuracy of positive, but not negative, predictions.","There is not enough information on how well tests for coronavirus (which causes Covid-19 - a breathing-related illness) can correctly diagnose a positive case (which signals presence of the virus) beyond 35 days after the start of Covid-19. This study aims to describe the percentage of positive coronavirus tests out of all tests, also called positivity rate, using three different measurements over a long period of time. Researchers took 268 samples from 180 Covid-19 patients with symptoms. These samples are tested using an RT-PCR test that finds traces of genetic material of the virus and a blood test to look for antibodies (proteins used by the immune system to fight infection). Researchers used 3 electrochemiluminescence assay (ECLIA) test formats that can look for multiple types of antibodies in the blood, 4 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) tests that test for antibodies for the coronavirus and can provide information about past exposure to Covid-19, and 1 lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) test format that can detect active coronavirus. After the first clinical sign for Covid-19 starts, the positivity rate and other measures to find the percentage of positive and negative (no virus) results in tests that are true positive, called positive predictive value, and true negative results, called negative predictive value, are calculated each week. Combinations of tests are measured to better understand how the primary tests are working. Maps are created to show how the different tests operate. During a follow-up period of more than 9 weeks, a type of ECLIA and one ELISA antibody test showed stable positivity rates after the third week. Except for ECLIA, the positive predictive value (percentage of positive tests that are true positives) of the other tests similar to ECLIA are ≥95% for Covid-19 only after the second week. ELISA and LFIA have somewhat lower positive predictive values. The IgM antibody that suggests a recent infection did not have enough information to do predictive calculations. An orthogonal testing approach is when a person who tests positive are tested again with a second test. Orthogonal testing provided a positive predictive value of ≥ 95% for patients who probably had the disease (e.g., symptomatic patients). After the second week, negative predictive values (percentage of negative test results that are true negatives) of all but the IgM antibody test are ≥95% for patients with a low or moderate chance of likely having the disease before being tested. When reading results from coronavirus tests, the estimate of the chance of having the disease before confirming with a test, the time that blood is drawn, and test characteristics must be considered.

30,34206895,"The number of serological assays for SARS-CoV-2 has skyrocketed in the past year. Concerns have been raised regarding their performance characteristics, depending on the disease severity and the time of the analysis post-symptom onset (PSO). Thus, independent validations using an unbiased sample selection are required for meaningful serology data interpretation. We aimed to assess the clinical performance of six commercially available assays, the seroconversion, and the dynamics of the humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The study included 528 serum samples from 156 patients with follow-up visits up to six months PSO and 161 serum samples from healthy people. The IgG/total antibodies positive percentage increased and remained above 95% after six months when chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA) IgG antiS1/S2 and electro-chemiluminescent assay (ECLIA) total antiNP were used. At early time points PSO, chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) IgM antiS achieved the best sensitivity. IgM and IgG appear simultaneously in most circumstances, and when performed in parallel the sensitivity increases. The severe and the moderate clinical forms were significantly associated with higher seropositivity percentage and antibody levels. High specificity was found in all evaluated assays, but the sensitivity was variable depending on the time PSO, severity of disease, detection method and targeted antigen.","The number of blood tests that check for antibodies (infection-fighting proteins) for the coronavirus (which causes COVID-19, the lung infection) has skyrocketed in the past year. Concerns have been raised on the performance of the tests, depending on the disease severity and the time of the test after symptoms start. Therefore, confirming the performance of the test using an unbiased sample is required in order to understand and describe the antibody data. Researchers aim to assess the performance of six available blood tests, the seroconversion (when the body starts producing antibodies), and how the body creates antibodies in response to coronavirus infection. The study included 528 blood samples from 156 patients with follow-up visits up to 6 months after the start of symptoms and 161 blood samples from healthy people. The total amount of antibodies increased and remained above 95% after six months when using certain tests to identify antibodies. At early times after the start of symptoms, a blood test that looks for certain antibodies that suggest recent infection has the best ability to correctly diagnose a positive (or virus-containing) case. Two types of antibodies, IgM and IgG, appear at the same time in most circumstances, and when performed together, the ability to correctly diagnose a positive diagnosis increases. The severe and the moderate clinical forms have major associations with a higher number of positive tests and antibody levels. The ability to correctly have a negative (or no virus) test among negative people is found in all evaluated blood tests, but the ability to correctly diagnose a true positive varies depending on the time after the start of symptoms and the type of test.",1,C

Samples from 57 hospitalized Covid-19 patients and 8 asymptomatic carriers (people who have the virus but no symptoms) are tested. Among seriously ill Covid-19 patients, there is a higher viral load in the throat, sputum (lung), and stool samples at 3-12 and 6-21 days after symptoms start. Among carriers with no symptoms, the viral load is found to stay for a shorter time period (1-8 days) in the throat and in the digestive system. Antibodies to fight the viruses responded in 51.4% of confirmed patients and 62.6% among asymptomatic people within 66 days from symptom starting. The average time between the start of symptoms and positive (or detected) antibodies is 30 days for the IgG antibody, and 23 days for the IgM antibodies, which often suggest a recent infection. Of 170 returning healthy-travelers to China, 4.7% were asymptomatic carriers within 2 weeks, and the positive result among them for the IgG and IgM antibodies is 12.8%. The IgM/IgG antibodies confirmed 3 suspected coronavirus cases, even though they tested negative for coronavirus using another test. When compared to other viruses that impact the lungs, Covid-19 has fewer asymptotic carriers and has a lower antibody response. Covid-19 also has a longer period of time developing antibodies in recovered patients. These findings highlight how complex transmission or spread is in Covid-19.",1,C

The authors have developed a method for controlled stone fragmentation using a continuous-wave diode laser with a hot-spot effect at the optical fiber end. The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of controlled urinary stone fragmentation using a continuous-wave diode laser with a highly heated distal end of the optical fiber light guide as a method of preventing inflammatory infections in clinical practice. Materials and methods: We analyzed 1666 case histories of urolithiasis patients who underwent percutaneous nephrolithotripsy/ nephrolithoextraction and contact ureterolithotripsy/ureteroextraction, we also performed a prospective analysis of complications based on the Clavien-Dindo classification in 90 patients who underwent fine fragmentation of stones with various lithotripters: ultrasonic, pneumatic, and holmium laser. The method of controlled stone fragmentation by a diode laser with a hot-spot effect was tested on postoperative samples of 26 renal calculi. For the first time in clinical practice, this method was tested in the bladder cavity (n=10). Results: In the percutaneous nephrolithotripsy group, postoperative infectious and inflammatory complications occurred in 34.1% of cases, in the percutaneous nephrolithoextraction group - in 24.6%, in the contact ureterolithotripsy group - in 7.8%, in the ureterolithoextraction group - in 2.5%.

The main complications are inflammatory infections that may result in pain, redness, or swelling. New and improved methods of breaking down stones, avoiding small stone fragments and sending them through the kidneys to be released through urine are searched. The authors develop a method to break stones using a continuous-wave diode laser, which is a constant stream of laser light that can also reduce the scattering of stones by using a hot-spot or energy-focused effect. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of controlling the fragmenting of urinary stones (hard masses of minerals in the bladder), using a continuous-wave diode laser as a method of preventing inflammatory infections. Researchers analyzed 1666 cases of patients with kidney stones who underwent different methods to remove kidney stones. These methods include percutaneous nephrolithotripsy/nephrolithoextraction (removal of stones by a small incision through the skin and stones pulled out of the incision) and ureterolithotripsy/ureteroextraction (when a flexible tube is inserted through the bladder and the ureter which connects the kidneys and bladder and stones are found with a camera and removed). An additional analysis on 90 patients is also done on patients with stones that were fragmented into tiny pieces using different lithotripters, non-surgical devices that crush stones using shock waves. The method of controlled stone fragmentation by a diode laser with a hot-spot effect is tested on samples of 26 kidney stones during or after operations. For the first time in clinical practice, this method is tested in the bladder (with 10 patients). In the group that underwent a small incision to remove the stone, infections and inflammation complications after the procedure occurred in 34.1% of cases. In the group that had stones removed from the incision (nephrolithoextraction) had complications in 24.6%, and in the ureterolithotripsy group where a tube and camera are used, there are 7.8% cases with complications.

Among them, the main issues are inflammatory infections. This influences the search for new, improved ways of breaking up stones to avoid small fragments and spreading stone-associated infection in the kidney and bladder system. We have created a method for controlled breaking up of stones with a special laser with a hot-spot at one end. This study evaluates the effectiveness of controlled breaking up of stones in urine using a special laser with a hot-spot at one end to prevent inflammatory infections in clinics. We analyzed 1666 patient cases of patients with kidney stones who had operations to remove the stones in the kidney and urine. We also analyzed any complications in 90 patients who had treatment with various devices to break up stones: sound waves, pressurized air, and lasers. The method of controlled breaking up of stones with a special laser with a hot-spot was tested on 26 kidney stone samples collected after surgery. For the first time in clinical practice, this method was tested in the hole in the bladder of 10 patients. In the group that had a small cut to remove kidney stones, infections and inflammatory issues after surgery occured in 34.1% of cases. In the group that had a cut and small tube to remove stones, infections and issues occured in 24.6%. In the group that had a small cut to remove stones in the urine, infections and issues occured in 7.8%. In the group that had a cut and tube to remove stones, infections and issues occured in 2.5%.

36,34540217,"Introduction: We determine the effect of patient characteristics (age, sex, and body mass index BMI) and stone characteristics (density, location, and size) by non-contrast computed tomography of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder (CT-KUB) in predicting the success of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) in the treatment of kidney and ureteric stones. We present this study to further enrich the knowledge of physicians towards the effect of different patient characteristics upon predicting extra-corporal shock wave lithotripsy success rates. Methods: We evaluated 155 patients who received ESWL for renal and ureteric stone measuring 3-20 mm (mm), over a 3-month period. The stone size in millimeters, density in Hounsfield units (HU) and its location was determined on pre-treatment CT-KUB. ESWL was successful if post-treatment residual renal stone fragments were ≤3 mm and for ureteric stones should be totally cleared. Results: The overall success of ESWL treatment was observed in 65.8% of the 155 patients. There was no significant difference seen when the effect of patients age, sex and BMI were studied with ESWL outcome with P values were 0.155, 0.101 and 0.415 respectively. Also, stone location either in the kidney or ureter has no statistically significant effect on ESWL response rate. while stone density and size determined on CT KUB have statistically significant effect on the success rate of ESWL with a P-value of 0.002 and 0.000 respectively. Conclusions: This study shows that determination of stone density and stone size on CT KUB pre ESWL can help to predict the outcome of ESWL. We propose that stone density <500 HU and stone size < 5 mm are highly likely to result in successful ESWL.","Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) is a procedure to break up stones in the body by using shock waves and an X-ray to target the stones. Researchers search for the effects of patient characteristics (age, sex, and body mass index or BMI) and stone characteristics (density, location, and size) on how successful ESWL procedure is on stones in the kidneys, ureters (tubes that carry urine from the kidney to the urinary bladder), and bladder. This study is intended to increase the knowledge of doctors on the effect of different patient characteristics on predicting how successful using extra-corporal shock wave lithotripsy is. Researchers evaluate 155 patients who receive ESWL for stones in the kidney and ureter (tube that carries urine from the kidney to the bladder) over a 3-month period. The stone size in millimeters (mm), density, and its location is determined using an x-ray scan before patients received treatment. ESWL is considered to be successful if the size of remaining kidney stone fragments after the procedure are ≤3 mm and if ureteric stones are totally cleared. The overall success of ESWL treatment was observed in 65.8% of the 155 patients. There is no major difference seen when the effect of age, sex, and BMI of patients are studied with ESWL outcomes. Also, stone location either in the kidney or ureter (the tube that carries urine from the kidney to the bladder) has no statistically significant effect (not likely to happen randomly or by chance) on the success of ESWL. Stone density and size based on the scanned images have a statistically significant effect on the success rate of ESWL. In conclusion, this study shows that finding out the density and size of stones using a scanned x-ray image before extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) can help predict the outcome of ESWL. Researchers of this study suggest that low stone density and size are highly likely to result in successful ESWL.",1,C

Details of technique, operative time, outcomes, need for further treatments, complications, and patients' satisfaction were evaluated. Results: Two hundred thirty-four fURS under SA were considered. SA was performed through L2-L3 vertebral interspace in 64.1%. Patients were discharged the same day of surgery. Mean stone burden was 13.5 ± 6.6 mm and mean operative time 76.9 ± 34.6 min. Single-procedure SFR was 69.7%. Further treatments were performed in 22.8%. 96.6% had no anesthesia-related complications. No Clavien-Dindo grade ≥ IIIb complications were noticed. 99.6% of patients were satisfied with SA. No cases of conversion from SA to GA occurred. Conclusion: fURS can be performed safely and efficiently under SA, taking into account a few details of the technique. Patients' satisfaction with SA is very high, and complications are rare. Although SA is usually adopted in unfit patients for GA, it may be considered as a viable alternative in fit patients.","Spinal anesthesia (SA) are medicines that numbs the back of patients to reduce pain after surgery. However, most urologists (doctors who specialize in conditions of the urinary or urine-related tract) use general anesthesia that puts a patient into a heavy sleep when doing a flexible ureterorenoscopy (fURS), a procedure that uses a telescope, and occasionally a laser, to break stones in the kidney into pieces. The objective of this study is to provide technical details, results, complications, and patients' satisfaction with fURS when performed under only spinal anesthesia to numb only parts of the body. Researchers analyzed all flexible ureterorenoscopy (fURS) done under spinal anesthesia to treat kidney stones from March 2011 to February 2017. Details of the technique, how long the procedure takes, results, need for additional treatments, complications, and patients' satisfaction are evaluated. There are 234 fURS procedures done under spinal anesthesia considered. SA was done in a certain area of the lower spine in 64.1%. Patients are sent home the same day of surgery. The average stone burden was 13.5 millimeters (± 6.6 millimeters), and the average procedure time is 76.9 minutes ( ± 34.6 minutes). The percentage of patients who are stone free after one procedure is 69.7%. Additional treatments are done in 22.8% of patients. Overall, 96.6% had no anesthesia-related complications. No complications that required general anesthesia or other major complications are noticed. 99.6% of patients are satisfied with spinal anesthesia. No cases of changing from spinal anesthesia to general anesthesia occurred. In conclusion, flexible ureterorenoscopy (fURS)can be performed safely and efficiently under spinal anesthesia when accounting for a few details of the procedure. Patients' satisfaction with spinal anesthesia is very high, and complications are rare.

36,34477130,"Background: This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of minimally invasive percutaneous nephrolithotomy (MPCNL) versus standard percutaneous nephrolithotomy in patients with renal and upper ureteric stones. Methods: We conducted a pooled analysis on randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The eligible RCTs were selected from the following databases: MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library. The reference lists of retrieved studies were also investigated. Results: Our analysis included 10 RCTs with 1612 patients. Pooled data from 10 RCTs revealed the following: stone-free rate (odds ratio = 1.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) [1.12,1.88], P = .004), operative time (mean difference [MD] = 4.10, 95% CI [-1.37,9.56], P = .14), length of hospital stay (MD = -15.31, 95% CI [-29.43,-1.19], P = .03), hemoglobin decrease (MD = -0.86, 95% CI [-1.19,-0.53], P < .00001), postoperative fever (MD = 0.83, 95% CI [0.49,1.40], P = .49), and urine leakage (MD = 0.59, 95% CI [0.25,1.37], P = .22). Besides, we performed sub-group analysis based on vacuum suction effect and multiple kidney stones. For vacuum suction effect, it revealed the following: stone-free rate in vacuum suction group (P = .007) and in non-vacuum suction group (P = .19). Operative time in vacuum suction group (P = .89), non-vacuum suction group (P = .16). Postoperative fever in vacuum suction group (P = .49), non-vacuum suction group (P = .85). Conclusion: This pooled analysis indicated that MPCNL was a safe and effective method for treating renal stones compared with standard percutaneous nephrolithotomy. Besides, the vacuum suction effect in MPCNL played a more important role. When it comes to multiple or staghorn stones, the longer operative time in MPCNL could not be ignored.","This study aims to assess the effectiveness and safety of minimally invasive percutaneous nephrolithotomy (MPCNL), when a doctor makes a small incision in the patient and uses a scope to remove kidney stones versus the standard percutaneous nephrolithotomy that uses a larger instrument to remove stones. Researchers analyze data from published clinical trials. Eligible trials are from the following databases: MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library. The articles of these clinical trials included a list of other existing studies that are also reviewed. The analysis includes 10 trials with 1612 patients. The data gathered and analyzed from the 10 trials found revealed information on the following: stone-free rate, how long the procedures take, length of hospital stay, red blood cells decrease, fever after the procedure, and urine leakage. Researchers also analyzed additional data on the effects of vacuum suction (vacuuming up stone fragments) and multiple kidney stones. For vacuum suction effect, it reveals a difference in the stone-free rate in the vacuum suction group but not in the non-vacuum suction group. There is no significant difference in how long the procedure took between the vacuum suction group and the non-vacuum suction group. There is no significant difference in having a fever after the procedure between the vacuum suction group and the non-vacuum suction group. In conclusion, this analysis suggests that minimally invasive percutaneous nephrolithotomy (MPCNL) is a safe and effective method for treating kidney stones compared with the standard percutaneous nephrolithotomy process. Additionally, the vacuum suction effect in MPCNL played a more important role. When it comes to multiple or staghorn (larger) stones, the longer procedure time in MPCNL could not be ignored.",1,C

The aim of our study is to compare the efficacy and safety of M-PCNL and RIRS in kidney stone treatment over 50 years old patients. A total of 125 patients, 65 of whom had RIRS, and 60 of whom had M-PCNL, were included in the study. Age, gender, BMI (Body-Mass Index), ASA (American Society of Anesthesiology) scores of the patients; stone size, stone location, operation side, ESWL history, HU (Hounsfield Unit) values, hospital stay durations, SFR, complication rates according to Clavien modification system, postoperative hemoglobin loss, postoperative transfusion rates, and patients who needed a secondary operation were recorded. SFR values were calculated in the postoperative third and sixth months. The data between the two groups had similar characteristics in terms of age, gender, BMI, HU, stone size, operation side, stone location, ESWL history, operation time, postoperative transfusion rate, postoperative Clavien complications (p > 0.05). When the ASA categories were evaluated, the mean ASA scores, ASA I, and ASA II data had similar characteristics in both groups (p > 0.05). When the ASA 3 scores were evaluated, the number of ASA III patients in the RIRS group was statistically significantly higher (p < 0.05). When hospital stay duration and postoperative hemoglobin loss were examined, RIRS group was found to be advantageous (p < 0.05). Postoperative third month SFR and Postoperative sixth month values were statistically significantly higher in M-PCNL group (p < 0.05). M-PCNL and RIRS are methods that can be used safely and effectively over 50 years old patients in kidney stone surgery.

Stone-free rates are calculated 3 months and 6 months after the procedure. The data between the RIRS and M-PCNL groups have similar characteristics in age, gender, BMI, HU, stone size, operation side, stone location, ESWL history, operation time, transfusion rates needed after the procedure, and complications after the procedure. When the ASA categories are evaluated to determine the risk of surgery before the procedure, the average ASA scores, ASA I, and ASA II data had similar characteristics in both groups. When the ASA 3 scores are evaluated, the number of ASA III patients in the RIRS group is statistically significantly (the result is unlikely to be random or by chance) higher. When hospital stay duration and blood loss after surgery are examined, the RIRS group is found to be beneficial. The stone-free rate at the 3rd and 6th months after surgery are statistically significantly higher in the M-PCNL group.

Shockwaves are generated and are then focused on a point within the body. The shockwaves propagate through the body with minimal dissipation of energy (and therefore damage) due to minimal difference in density of the soft tissues. At the stone fluid interface, a relatively significant difference in density, combined with a large concentration of multiple shockwaves in a small area, produces a significant dissipation of energy. Through the different mechanisms, this energy can overcome the tensile strength of the stone resulting in fragmentation.

The success of ESWL comes from pulverizing stones into small stones, which are removed naturally by the body. Shockwaves are created and focused on a point in the body. The shockwaves spread through the body with minimal loss of energy (and therefore damage) due to small density or hardness differences of the surrounding body parts.

We aimed to evaluate if lasers perform as equal as non-laser devices in patients with kidney stones candidate to PCNL. Materials and methods A comprehensive literature search was performed in MEDLINE via PubMed, Scopus and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) to assess the differences in the perioperative course, incidence of postoperative complications, and stone free-rate (SFR) in patients with kidney stones undergoing laser versus non-laser PCNL in randomized studies. The incidences of complications were pooled using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel Method with the random effect model and expressed as Risk Ratios (RR), 95% Confidence Intervals (CI), and p-values. Surgical time and length of stay were pooled using the inverse variance of the mean difference (MD) with a random effect, 95% CI, and p-values. Analyses were two-tailed, with a significance set at p ≤0.05. Results Six papers including 732 patients (311 patients undergoing holmium laser and 421 non-laser PCNL) were included in meta-analysis. Surgical time and postoperative stay were shorter in the non-laser group (MD:11.14, 95% CI:2.32-19.96, p=0.002; MD:-0.81, 95%CI:-2.18-0.57 p=0.25, respectively). SFR was significantly higher in the non-laser group (RR:1.08, 95% CI:1.01-1.15, p=0.03). Patients undergoing laser PCNL had a non-significant higher risk of postoperative fever >38°C (RR:0.64, 95%CI: .31-1.30, p=0.22). Transfusion rate did not differ between the two groups (RR:1.02, 95% CI:0.50-2.11 p=0.95). The need for stent positioning due to urine extravasation was higher risk in the laser group but the difference did not reach significance (RR:0.49, 95% CI:0.17-1.41 p=0.19). Conclusions Non-laser PCNL showed better perioperative outcomes and SFR as compared to holmium laser PCNL.","Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) is a procedure that involves making an incision in the skin, inserting a tube to reach the stone, breaking it up into small pieces - sometimes using a laser, and removing it from the body.

Researchers searched published studies to find the differences in the preparation before or during surgery, the number of complications after surgery, and the stone-free rate (patients that no longer have stone or stone fragments) in patients with kidney stones who had either laser or non-laser PCNL. The number of complications are pooled together and analyzed. How long the procedure takes and length of stay at the hospital or doctor office are also analyzed. Six papers including 732 patients (311 patients underwent the procedure with a laser PCNL and 421 with a non-laser PCNL) are included in the analysis. Surgical time and post-operation stay were shorter in the non-laser group. The stone free rate is significantly higher in the non-laser group. Patients undergoing laser PCNL had a slightly higher risk of a fever >100.4°F after the procedure. The need for a blood transfusion (transfer) is not different between the laser and non-laser group. There is a higher need in the laser group for a thin tube called a stent to be placed in the body to help drain urine, but it is not a major difference between the two groups on needing a stent.

The complicated contractility profile of the ureter, which alters with age, tissue segment region, orientation and species contributes to the difficulty of interpreting studies on ureteral pharmacology, which translates to the complexity of discovering ideal drug targets for medical expulsive therapy. Nevertheless, the current drug classes clinically used for patients with stone lodgement include α1 -adrenoceptor antagonists, calcium channel blockers and NSAIDS, whilst there are promising targets for drug development that require further clinical investigations including the phosphodiesterase type 5 enzyme, β-adrenoceptors and 5-HT receptors.","Medical expulsive therapy uses medication to relax certain muscles in the body to release small kidney stones.

This review focuses on the findings from animal and human studies that investigate the ways drugs work in the ureter and how drugs may potentially help release stones from the body. How the ureter tube, that carries urine from the kidney to the bladder, is able to contract changes over time and makes interpreting results from studies on drugs difficult and, therefore, hard to find the best drugs for medical explusive therapy.

42,33827674,"Background: The oncogenic role of histone mutations is one of the most relevant discovery in cancer epigenetics. Recurrent mutations targeting histone genes have been described in pediatric brain tumors, chondroblastoma, giant cell tumor of bone and other tumor types. The demonstration that mutant histones can be oncogenic and drive the tumorigenesis in pediatric tumors, led to the coining of the term ""oncohistones."" The first identified histone mutations were localized at or near residues normally targeted by post-translational modifications (PTMs) in the histone N-terminal tails and suggested a possible interference with histone PTMs regulation and reading. Main body: In this review, we describe the peculiar organization of the multiple genes that encode histone proteins, and the latter advances in both the identification and the biological role of histone mutations in cancer. Recent works show that recurrent somatic mutations target both N-terminal tails and globular histone fold domain in diverse tumor types. Oncohistones are often dominant-negative and occur at higher frequencies in tumors affecting children and adolescents. Notably, in many cases the mutations target selectively only some of the genes coding the same histone protein and are frequently associated with specific tumor types or, as documented for histone variant H3.3 in pediatric glioma, with peculiar tumors arising from specific anatomic locations. Conclusion: The overview of the most recent advances suggests that the oncogenic potential of histone mutations can be exerted, together with the alteration of histone PTMs, through the destabilization of nucleosome and DNA-nucleosome interactions, as well as through the disruption of higher-order chromatin structure. However, further studies are necessary to fully elucidate the mechanism of action of oncohistones, as well as to evaluate their possible application to cancer classification, prognosis and to the identification of new therapies.","The cancer or tumor causing role of changes to histone proteins is one of the most important discoveries in cancer research. Histones are proteins that provide structural support to a chromosome and sometimes act as the spool that the thread-like DNA wraps around. Recurring mutations (changes) that target histone genes are described in brain tumors in children, in a rare type of noncancerous bone tumor that begins in cartilage chondroblastoma (noncancerous bone tumors in cartilage), and in giant tumors of bones and other types of tumors. The finding that mutant histones can cause cancer and tumors, also called oncogenic, and drive development of tumors in children lead to the new term ""onchohistones"". In this review, researchers describe the organization of the multiple genes that build histone proteins and the role of histone mutations in cancer. Recent works show that recurring mutations during pregnancy target both N-terminal (nitrogen-containing) tails that are on histones and interact with DNA and the central part of the histone that folds in different types of tumors. Oncohistones (the mutant histones that can cause tumors) often occur more in tumors affecting children and adolescents.

42,33240489,"Extracellular histones released from injured or dying cells following trauma and other severe insults can act as potent damage-associated molecular patterns. In fact, elevated levels of histones are present in human circulation in hyperinflammatory states such as acute respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis. The molecular mechanisms owing to histone-induced pathologies are at the very beginning of elucidating. However, neutralization of histones with antibodies, histone-binding or histone-degrading proteins, and heparan sulfates have shown promising therapeutic effects in pre-clinical acute respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis models. Various cell types undergoing necrosis and apoptosis or activated neutrophils forming neutrophil extracellular traps have been implicated in excessive release of histones which further augments tissue injury and may culminate in multiple organ failure. At the molecular level, an uncontrolled inflammatory cascade has been considered as the major event; however, histone-activated coagulation and thrombosis represent additional pathologic events reflecting coagulopathy. Furthermore, epigenetic regulation and chemical modifications of circulating histones appear to be critically important in their biological functions as evidenced by increased cytotoxicity associated with citrullinated histone. Herein, we will briefly review the current knowledge on the role of histones in acute respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis, and discuss the future potential of anti-histone therapy for treatment of these life-threatening disorders.","Histones are proteins that provide structural support to a chromosome and sometimes act as the spool that the thread-like DNA wraps around. Histones that are released from injured or dying cells and remain outside of cells can lead to damaged molecules. In fact, there are high levels of histones in humans during hyperinflammatory states, when the immune system goes into overdrive, such as acute respiratory or breathing-related distress or sepsis, which occurs when the body's response to an infection damages its own tissues. Understanding this process of changes in molecules because of histones is just starting. However, making histones ineffective with antibodies (infection-fighting proteins), histones that attach to or break down proteins, and certain carbohydrate (sugar-containing) molecules that regulate functions of blood vessel walls have shown promising treatment effects in computer models of acute respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis. Various cell types that are dying or are activated in the neutrophil extracellular traps (net like structures that protect against infection) are likely involved in too many histones being released which can worsen tissue injury and may result in multiple organ failure. An uncontrolled inflammation response is considered as the major event; however, blood clotting or scabbing because of histones are new events showing a bleeding disorder. Also, regulating how the environment can cause changes that affect the way genes work and chemical changes of histones appear to be very important in their functions. In this paper, researchers review the current knowledge of the role of histones in acute respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis, and discuss potential anti-histone treatment of these life-threatening disorders.",1,B

42,34667098,"Histones constitute the chief protein component of DNA. They help to maintain chromatin structure and regulate gene expression. The long double-stranded DNA molecule winds around histone octamers to form nucleosomes which serve the purpose of compacting DNA within the confines of the nuclear membrane. There are five major types of histones, namely H1/H5, H2, H3 and H4. H3.3 is a subtype of H3 histone and can be encoded either by the H3F3A or H3F3B genes independently. Amino acids such as lysine and arginine found in the histone tails are sites of post-translational modifications (PTMs) such as methylation and acetylation. These PTMs in histones are involved in the regulation of gene expression by chromatin remodelling and by controlling DNA methylation patterns. Mutations in histone genes can affect sites of PTMs causing changes in local and global DNA methylation status. These effects are directly linked to neoplastic transformation by altered gene expression.

Here, we describe an approach to couple fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) with targeted mass spectrometry to define global ""epi-proteomic"" signatures for primary leukocytes. FACS was used to sort closely and distantly related leukocytes from normal human peripheral blood for quantitation of histone PTMs with a multiple reaction monitoring LC-MS/MS method measuring histone PTMs on histones H3 and H4. We validate cell sorting directly into H2SO4 for immediate histone extraction to decrease time and number of steps after FACS to analyze histone PTMs. Relative histone PTM levels vary in T cells across healthy donors, and the majority of PTMs remain stable up to 2 days following initial blood draw. Large differences in the levels of histone PTMs are observed across the mature lymphoid and myeloid lineages, as well as between different types within the same lineage, though no differences are observed in closely related T cell subtypes.

The primary target of metformin, the electron transport chain complex I in the mitochondria, is associated with redox homeostasis in immune cells, which plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases.

The mechanism by which this therapeutic effect was achieved is largely unknown. Metformin regulates redox homeostasis in a context-specific manner. Multiple cell types contribute to SLE, with evidence of increased mitochondrial oxidative stress in T cells and neutrophils.

Metformin targets certain cells in the immune system that play a critical role in development of autoimmune diseases, which are diseases where the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy cells and tissues. This review addresses the evidence and knowledge gaps on whether a beneficial effect of metformin in lupus may be due to a restoration of redox homeostasis, a balanced level of reactive oxygen molecules that signal to other cells. Clinical trials in lupus patients with mild to moderate disease activity and studies in mice have provided encouraging results for metformin. The mechanism that creates this therapeutic effect is largely unknown. Metformin regulates redox homeostasis in specific situations. Multiple cell types contribute to lupus.

48,34619975,"Significance: Metformin has been proposed as a treatment for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The primary target of metformin, the electron transport chain complex I in the mitochondria, is associated with redox homeostasis in immune cells, which plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. This review addresses the evidence and knowledge gaps on whether a beneficial effect of metformin in lupus may be due to a restoration of a balanced redox state. Recent Advances: Clinical trials in SLE patients with mild to moderate disease activity and preclinical studies in mice have provided encouraging results for metformin. The mechanism by which this therapeutic effect was achieved is largely unknown. Metformin regulates redox homeostasis in a context-specific manner. Multiple cell types contribute to SLE, with evidence of increased mitochondrial oxidative stress in T cells and neutrophils. Critical issues: The major knowledge gaps are whether the efficacy of metformin is linked to a restored redox homeostasis in the immune system, and if it does, in which cell types it occurs? We also need to know which patients may have a better response to metformin, and whether it corresponds to a specific mechanism?

The primary target of metformin, a specific energy-generator in the cell, is linked with electrical balance in immune cells, which influence the creation of diseases in which immune cells mistakely attack healthy cells. This article reviews the evidence and knowledge gaps on whether metformin's beneficial effects in lupus may be due to a restored, balanced electrical state. Clinical trials in SLE patients with mild to moderate disease severity and mice studies show encouraging results for metformin. How this beneficial effect is achieved is largely unknown. Metformin monitors electrical balance depending on the situation. Multiple cell types contribute to SLE, with evidence of increased cellular stress in certain immune cells called T cells and neutrophils. The major knowledge gaps are whether the success of metformin is linked to a restored electrical balance in the immune system. If it does, in which cell types it occurs? We also need to know which patients may have a better response to metformin, and if it corresponds to a specfic biological process?

48,34618348,"Introduction: Low-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) selectively restores disturbances of regulatory T cells (Treg) and conventional T cells, resulting in the induction of remission in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. However, to date no research has been carried out on the efficacy of low-dose IL-2 in the treatment of refractory lupus nephritis (LN). The aim of the study reported here was to investigate the renal response to low-dose IL-2 in patients with refractory LN. Methods: The study population comprised ten patients with refractory LN who failed to achieve complete response or who had relapsed while being treated with at least two conventional immunosuppressive agents. One treatment cycle consisted of IL-2 at a dose of 1 million IU administered subcutaneously every other day for 2 weeks followed by a 2-week break. All patients received three cycles of IL-2 and were then followed up for another 12 weeks without any increase in the dose of previous immunosuppressive agents and steroids. Results: Of the ten patients enrolled in the study, seven (70%) achieved ≥ 50% improvement in proteinuria at 12 weeks after initiating treatment with IL-2. Median proteinuria was significantly reduced by 50.3% at week 12, from 1.83 (interquartile range [IQR] 1.23-3.21) g/24 h at baseline to 0.91 (IQR 0.52-1.60) g/24 h at 12 weeks (P = 0.005). This was accompanied by a 71% reduction in urine erythrocytes, from 64/µl (IQR 24-102/µl) at baseline to 18/µl (IQR 2-20/µl) at 12 weeks (P = 0.018). Anti-ds DNA was decreased from 27.9 (IQR 7.6-40.28) IU/ml at baseline to 14.1 (IQR 7.3-20.12) IU/ml (P = 0.021) at week 12, while complements C3 and C4 were slightly increased (P = 0.445, P = 0.241, respectively). A significant expansion of Treg cells, from 9.3% at baseline to 16.6% at 12 weeks, was also found (P < 0.05). No serious adverse events occurred during the treatment period. Conclusions: Low-dose IL-2 therapy may have a promising role in the treatment of refractory LN as an alternative and safe therapeutic approach. It may be used as multi-target combination therapy in clinical practice.","Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a type of protein that promotes and develops immune cells at the start of an immune response and keeps them alive. A low-dose of interleukin-2 can restore changes of immune cells called T cells and Treg cells, resulting in the start of remission (recovery) in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus - when your immune system attacks healthy cells). However, to date, no research has been carried out on the effectiveness of low-dose IL-2 in the treatment of lupus nephritis, a type of kidney disease caused by lupus. The aim of this study is to investigate the kidney response to low-dose IL-2 in patients with lupus nephritis that is not responding to standard treatment. The study includes 10 patients with lupus nephritis who failed to achieve a complete response to standard treatment or who improved and then worsened while being treated with at least two standard treatments. One treatment cycle consists of IL-2 given by an injection every other day for 2 weeks followed by a 2-week break. All patients receive three cycles of IL-2 and are then followed up for another 12 weeks without any increase in the dose of the previous treatments or steroids. Of the 10 patients enrolled in the study, 7 (70%) achieved 50% or more improvement in proteinuria (elevated levels of protein in the urine) at 12 weeks after starting IL-2 treatment. Average proteinuria is significantly reduced by 50.3% at week 12. There is also a 71% decrease in red blood cells in urine at 12 weeks. An antibody (infection-fighting molecule) associated with lupus called anti-ds DNA decreased from the start of the study to week 12, while protein complements C3 and C4 used to monitor the immune systems are slightly increased. A significant expansion of the immune Treg cells, from 9.3% at the start of the study to 16.6% at 12 weeks, is also found. No serious negative events occurred while patients receive the treatment. In conclusion, low-dose IL-2 therapy may have a promising role in the treatment of refractory lupus nephritis as an alternative and safe treatment approach. Low-dose IL-2 may be used in combination with other medicines in clinical practice.",1,C

We compared obinutuzumab, a humanised type II anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody that induces potent B-cell depletion, with placebo for the treatment of LN in combination with standard therapies. Methods: Patients with LN receiving mycophenolate and corticosteroids were randomised to obinutuzumab 1000 mg or placebo on day 1 and weeks 2, 24 and 26, and followed through week 104. The primary endpoint was complete renal response (CRR) at week 52. Exploratory analyses through week 104 were conducted. The prespecified alpha level was 0.2. Results: A total of 125 patients were randomised and received blinded infusions. Achievement of CRR was greater with obinutuzumab at week 52 (primary endpoint, 22 (35%) vs 14 (23%) with placebo; percentage difference, 12% (95% CI -3.4% to 28%), p=0.115) and at week 104 (26 (41%) vs 14 (23%); percentage difference, 19% (95% CI 2.7% to 35%), p=0.026). Improvements in other renal response measures, serologies, estimated glomerular filtration rate and proteinuria were greater with obinutuzumab. Obinutuzumab was not associated with increases in serious adverse events, serious infections or deaths. Non-serious infusion-related reactions occurred more frequently with obinutuzumab. Conclusions: Improved renal responses through week 104 were observed in patients with LN who received obinutuzumab plus standard therapies compared with standard therapies alone.

54,30848135,"Objective: To examine patients after embryo transfer for predictive influence of the human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) level on the probability of finishing pregnancy with delivery. Methods: 490 patients pregnant after IVF + ET treatment placed in the study. The influence of other factors: age (patients 20-50), number of transferred embryos (one, two and more) and the length of cultivation on the probability of finishing pregnancy with delivery or loss and the possibility to predict multiple pregnancy was also related to the known hCG value. The transferred embryos were divided into two groups - early (cultivation 48 and 72 hrs) and prolonged cultivation (PC 96 and 120 hrs). The answer here, therefore, is a multinomial variable with four levels. For that reason the data was analysed through a multinomial logistic model vs. multinomial distribution of a mistake and generalised logistic link function. Results: The hCG level grows exponentially in the course of the 9th to 17th day after an embryo transfer (ET). The probability of one child delivery after the transfer of one embryo overdue after prolonged cultivation (96 or 120 hrs) grows with the average and above-average hCG values on the day of the draw. The hCG value was 678 (564-815) IU/l1 on the 14th day after ET in pregnancy ended in delivery, 321 (216-477) IU/l on average in abortion, 82 (51-132) IU/l in biochemical pregnancy and 1070 (737-1554) IU/l in multiple pregnancy. The probability of multiple pregnancy increased with hCG values greatly above the average and on the other hand, below-average values indicated abortion or biochemical pregnancy. The patients age was not proven to be of significant influence, the hCG level slightly decreased with higher age. On the contrary, an increasing frequency of abortions depending on the increasing age of the mother was once again confirmed.

This study also aimed to predict if multiple pregnancy was related to hCG value. The transferred embryos were divided into two groups - early (cultivation 48 and 72 hrs) and prolonged cultivation (PC 96 and 120 hrs). Because of this, the data was evaluated in several levels. The data was analyzed through several statistical algorithms. The hCG level grew more and more rapidly in the course of the 9th to 17th day after an embryo transfer (ET). Probability of one child delivery after the transfer of one embryo overdue after prolonged cultivation grows with increased hCG values on the day of the draw. The hCG value determined what type of pregnancy would occur. The probability of multiple pregnancy increased with hCG values above the average. However, below-average hCG values indicated abortion or biochemical pregnancy. Patients age was not proven to be of significant influence. The hCG level slightly decreased with higher age. An increase in frequency of abortions correlating (linking) to increased age of the mother was once again confirmed. The measured hCG values are considerably different depending on the pregnancy result. Because of this, hCG value is considered a quality predictive factor of the pregnancy result.",1,C

Aim: Aim of the study was to determine the trends of hCG levels in EP and to explore the role of hCG in decisions related to management and follow-up of EPs. Materials and methods: A retrospective study of women who had EPs from January 2006 to December 2012 at an advanced tertiary care centre in southern India was carried out. These women had undergone treatment based on the hospital protocol. Results: The study identified 337 women with EP. Thirty one surgically confirmed cases were diagnosed below the discriminatory zone of 1500 mIU/ml. Among women who had Beta hCG estimations 48 hours apart, plateauing was observed in 22.5% while decrease >15% was noted in 26.8%. Almost half (47.9%) of the cases had an increase >15% and a few (2.8%) demonstrated an initial fall followed by a rise in titres. In 23.9% of these women, there was a rise >53% similar to intrauterine pregnancy. The average pre-treatment Beta hCG was 429.8, 3866.2 and 12961.5 mIU/ml for those who received expectant, medical and direct surgical treatment respectively. 43 women with relative contraindications received medical management and 39 were lost to follow-up after medical and expectant management. Excluding them, the success rate of these two modalities was 76.6% and 85.0% respectively. Conclusion: No single level of Beta hCG is diagnostic of EP and serial levels can demonstrate atypical trends in some cases. Hence, interpretation of these results should be done in conjunction with clinical and sonographic findings to arrive at a correct diagnosis.","Signs of Ectopic (outer-uterus or outer-womb) Pregnancy (EP) can be highly variable.

54,26368010,"The objective was to determine the strength of relationship between maternal free beta human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) concentrations and rates of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Consecutive records of the database of our Down screening project were assessed for free β-hCG levels and pregnancy outcomes. Pregnancies with foetal chromosomal or structural anomalies and those with underlying disease were excluded. Free β-hCG levels of < 0.5, > 0.5 and < 2.0, and ≥ 2.0 MoM were categorised as low, normal and high, respectively. Of 17,082 screened women, 13,620 were available for analysis. In the first trimester (n = 8150), low β-hCG levels significantly increased risk for intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), preterm birth, low birth weight (LBW) and low Apgar score with relative risk of 1.66, 1.43, 1.83 and 2.89; whereas high β-hCG group had a significant decreased risk of preterm birth and GDM with relative risk of 0.73 and 0.62. In the second trimester (n = 5470), both low and high β-hCG groups had significant increased risks of the most common adverse outcomes, i.e. spontaneous abortion, IUGR and preterm birth. In conclusion, abnormally low (< 0.5MoM) or high (> 2.0 MoM) free β-hCG levels are generally associated with an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes.

54,24724425,"Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is generally quantified in serum, but spot urine samples are also used to assess hCG levels in Japan. The purpose of the present study was to elucidate whether urinary hCG can be used clinically as a substitute for serum hCG. A total of 189 samples of serum and spot urine were collected from patients, including cases of normal pregnancy (NP) -13, abortion (AB) -21, extrauterine pregnancy (EP) 25, and hydatidiform mole (MOL) -7, during medical treatment and comparisons were made concerning serum and urinary hCG levels. The histogram of relative urinary/serum hCG(U-hCG.act/S-hCG) of the samples showed a wide distribution of values, but tended to converge to a narrow distribution by creatinine correction (U-hCG.cor/S-hCG). U-hCG.cor/S-hCG of the AB, EP, and MOL groups decreased 1 day to 14 days or was no earlier than 15 days postoperatively compared to preoperatively. The alteration of serum Intact/Total tended to be similar to that of U-hCG.cor/S-hCG in clinical course. The presented case indicated that U-hCG.act/S-hCG did not correspond to serum hCG levels. Because urinary hCG levels are inconsistent depending on whether spot urine is concentrated or diluted, the levels of hCG in spot urine do not always correlate with serum levels of hCG. Therefore, the data of urinary hCG should be interpreted after creatinine correction. Overall, it is recommended to determine serum hCG levels rather than creatinine corrected urinary hCG levels, considering that the relative urinary/serum hCG was not constant postoperatively.","Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG - a pregnancy hormone) is generally measured in serum (blood).

61,28665969,"Background: There is a clinical need for new therapeutic products against Herpes simplex virus (HSV). The pomegranate, fruit of the tree Punica granatum L, has since ancient times been linked to activity against infection. This work probed the activity of pomegranate rind extract (PRE) and co-administered zinc (II) ions. Materials and methods: PRE was used in conjunction with zinc (II) salts to challenge HSV-1 and aciclovir-resistant HSV in terms of virucidal plaque assay reduction and antiviral activities in epithelial Vero host cells. Cytotoxicity was determined by the MTS assay using a commercial kit. Results: Zinc sulphate, zinc citrate, zinc stearate and zinc gluconate demonstrated similar potentiated virucidal activity with PRE against HSV-1 by up to 4-fold. A generally parabolic relationship was observed when HSV-1 was challenged with PRE and varying concentrations of ZnSO4, with a maximum potentiation factor of 5.5. Punicalagin had 8-fold greater virucidal activity than an equivalent mass of PRE. However, antiviral data showed that punicalagin had significantly lower antiviral activity compared to the activity of PRE (EC50 = 0.56 μg mL-1) a value comparable to aciclovir (EC50 = 0.18 μg mL-1); however, PRE also demonstrated potency against aciclovir-resistant HSV (EC50 = 0.02 μg mL-1), whereas aciclovir showed no activity. Antiviral action of PRE was not influenced by ZnSO4. No cytotoxicity was detected with any test solution. Conclusions: The potentiated virucidal activity of PRE by coadministered zinc (II) has potential as a multi-action novel topical therapeutic agent against HSV infections, such as coldsores.","New treatments are needed for Herpes simplex virus (HSV) that causes cold sores or genital herpes.

Zinc sulphate, zinc citrate, zinc stearate and zinc gluconate worked similarly against HSV that causes cold sores, and increased the effect of PKE up to 4-fold. Punicalagin, a chemical extracted from pomegranate, was 8 times more effective against the virus than an equivalent amount of PKE. Punicalagin, a chemical extracted from pomegranate, was 8 times more effective killing the virus than an equivalent amount of PKE. Punicalagin was less effective than PKE in fighting the virus and suppressing its growth. PKE was comparable to the drug aciclovir.

Other factors are age and the time over which zinc is ingested. Zinc from supplements has not been shown to be absorbed differently from that taken with meals that lack inhibitors of zinc absorption.

Models show that the majority of differences in how much zinc will get into the body is due to the presence of zinc and phytate in the food. Our model shows that an adult body takes in about 6 milligrams a day. If the daily meals contain a gram of phytate, twice the recommended daily amount of zinc is needed. Zinc is removed with stools depending on how much zinc the body took in and how much was present. The relation between zinc that is taken in and removed determines how much zinc should be taken.

The amount of zinc absorbed by the body is not different whether the zinc comes from supplements like pills or from food. Some compounds found in certain foods can make it harder for the body to absorb zinc. The body absorbs zinc differently depending on the amount of zinc or the amount of phytate in the amount already. The results were added to previous data and now we know that adults can absorb at most 6mg of zinc a day. A person needs to take double the normal amount of zinc if getting 1000mg of phytate through food and medication. The body gets rid of zinc according to how much zinc is already in the body and how much has been absorbed recently. How much zinc is lost and how much is absorbed is important to know so that people get the right amount of zinc.

While this phenomenon is well studied in certain bacterial infections, much less is known regarding viral infections. Iron metabolism also has implications on the functionality of cells of the immune system. Once primed by the contact with antigen presenting cells, lymphocytes need iron to sustain the metabolic burst required for mounting an effective cellular and humoral response.

Here we review the intersections between iron metabolism and COVID-19, belonging to the wider domain of the so-called ""nutritional immunity"".

Once stimulated by touching cells with parts of foreign organisms attached to them, immune cells need iron to sustain the energy needed for an effective cellular and immune response. The COVID-19 pandemic (caused by a virus causing a lung infection) has boosted clinical and medical research over the possible influences of nutrients on SARS-CoV-2 infection, in terms of either contracting or aiding the infection. Here we review the links between iron metabolism and COVID-19, belonging to the wider field of study of the so-called ""nutritional immunity"". A better understanding of these links may help develop more effective strategies for managing COVID-19 and possible future pandemics.",2,C

While the association of the iron metabolism with the prognosis of COVID-19 remains poorly understood. We aimed to estimate the associations of systemic iron metabolism parameters with the severity and risks of adverse outcomes in COVID-19. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, we included 158 confirmed COVID-19 patients in Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, China (27 January to 5 April, 2020). Demographic data, comorbidities, laboratory examinations, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected. Multivariable Poisson regression was used to estimate the association of iron parameter levels with the severity and risks of adverse outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Results: We identified 60 (38%) severe cases in 158 COVID-19 patients. The median age was 63 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 54-73) and the median length of hospital stay was 28 days (IQR: 17-40). After adjusting for age, sex, IL-6, and pre-existing comorbidities, all iron parameters were associated with the severity of COVID-19 with adjusted risk ratio of 0.42 [95% CI: 0.22-0.83], 4.38 [95% CI: 1.86-10.33], 0.19 [95% CI: 0.08-0.48], and 0.25 [95% CI: 0.10-0.58] for serum iron, ferritin, transferrin, and total iron-binding capacity, respectively. These iron indices were also related to the risk of ARDS, coagulopathy, acute cardiac injury, acute liver injury, and acute kidney injury in COVID-19 patients and high cytokine concentrations. Conclusions: Patients with low serum iron status likely suffered from severe condition and multiple-organ injury in COVID-19. The iron metabolism parameters might be risk factors and clinical biomarkers for COVID-19 prognosis.","The background of this study is that iron is a necessary element to almost all living beings. The delicate balance between host immune system and viral growth plays an important role in infections. The link between iron metabolism and recovery from COVID-19 (a viral lung infection) remains poorly understood.

In this clinical study, we included 158 confirmed COVID-19 patients in Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, China (27 January to 5 April, 2020). Basic background data, other diseases, lab tests, treatments, and clinical results were all collected. A specific mathematical test was used to estimate the links between iron levels with the severity and risks of side effects in COVID-19 patients. As a result, we identified 60 (38%) severe cases in 158 COVID-19 patients. The average age was 63 years, and the average length of hospital stay was 28 days. After adjusting for age, sex, immune signals, and pre-existing diseases, all iron measures were linked with the severity of COVID-19 for blood iron and iron-containing proteins. These iron measures were also linked to the risk of a serious lung condition that leads to low blood oxygen, excessive bleeding or clotting, immediate heart-related injury, immediate liver injury, and immediate kidney injury in COVID-19 patients and high immune signal levels. In conclusion, patients with low blood iron likely suffered from severe effects of and multiple-organ injury in COVID-19.

We evaluated iron metabolism and immune response in 303 patients admitted to the main hospital of the northern region of Portugal with variable clinical pictures, from September to November 2020. One hundred and twenty-seven tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 176 tested negative. Iron-related laboratory parameters and cytokines were determined in blood samples collected soon after admission. Demographic data, comorbidities and clinical outcomes were recorded. Patients were assigned into five groups according to severity. Serum iron and transferrin levels at admission were lower in COVID-19-positive than in COVID-19-negative patients. The levels of interleukin (IL)-6 and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) were increased in COVID-19-positive patients. The lowest serum iron and transferrin levels at diagnosis were associated with the worst outcomes. Iron levels negatively correlated with IL-6 and higher levels of this cytokine were associated with a worse prognosis.

We suggest benefits of a lower range of serum ferritin as has occurred for total serum cholesterol and fasting blood glucose levels. Observations during a prospective randomized study using phlebotomy in patients with peripheral arterial disease offered unique insights into dual roles of serum ferritin both as an iron status marker and acute phase reactant. Robust positive associations between serum ferritin, interleukin 6 [IL-6], tissue necrosis factor-alpha, and high sensitivity C-reactive protein were discovered. Elevated serum ferritin and IL-6 levels associated with increased mortality and with reduced mortality at ferritin levels <100 ng mL-1. Epidemiologic studies demonstrate similar outcomes.

68,34883281,"While it took decades to arrive to a conclusion that ferritin is more than an indicator of iron storage level, it took a short period of time through the COVID-19 pandemic to wonder what the reason behind high levels of ferritin in patients with severe COVID-19 might be.

Moreover, the behavior of ferritin in patients with severe COVID-19 and the subsequent high mortality rates in patients with high ferritin levels necessitated further investigations to understand the role of ferritin in the diseases. Ferritin was initially described to accompany various acute infections, both viral and bacterial, indicating an acute response to inflammation. However, with the introduction of the hyperferritinemic syndrome connecting four severe pathological conditions such as adult-onset Still's disease, macrophage activation syndrome, catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome, and septic shock added another aspect of ferritin where it could have a pathogenetic role rather than an extremely elevated protein only. In fact, suggesting that COVID-19 is a new member in the spectrum of hyperferritinemic syndrome besides the four mentioned conditions could hopefully direct further search on the pathogenetic role of ferritin.

68,35240553,"Background: Several studies have suggested that COVID-19 is a systemic disease that can affect several organs, including the brain. In the brain, specifically, viral infection can cause dyshomeostasis of some trace elements that promote complex biochemical reactions in specialized neurological functions. Objective: Understand the neurovirulence of SARS-CoV-2 and the relationship between trace elements and neurological disorders after infection, and provide new insights on the drug development for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Methods: The main databases were used to search studies published up September 2021, focusing on the role of trace elements during viral infection and on the correct functioning of the brain. Results: The imbalance of important trace elements can accelerate SARS-CoV-2 neurovirulence and increase the neurotoxicity since many neurological processes can be associated with the homeostasis of metal and metalloproteins. Some studies involving animals and humans have suggested the synapse as a vulnerable region of the brain to neurological disorders after viral infection. Considering the combined evidence, some mechanisms have been suggested to understand the relationship between neurological disorders and imbalance of trace elements in the brain after viral infection. Conclusion: Trace elements play important roles in viral infections, such as helping to activate immune cells, produce antibodies, and inhibit virus replication. However, the relationship between trace elements and virus infections is complex since the specific functions of several elements remain largely undefined.

68,35008695,"During infections, the host redistributes iron in order to starve pathogens from this nutrient. Several proteins are involved in iron absorption, transport, and storage. Ferritin is the most important iron storage protein. It is composed of variable proportions of two peptides, the L- and H-ferritins (FTL and FTH). We previously showed that macrophages increase their expression of FTH1 when they are infected in vitro with Mycobacterium avium, without a significant increase in FTL. In this work, we investigated the role of macrophage FTH1 in M. avium infection in vivo. We found that mice deficient in FTH1 in myeloid cells are more resistant to M. avium infection, presenting lower bacterial loads and lower levels of proinflammatory cytokines than wild-type littermates, due to the lower levels of available iron in the tissues. Importantly, we also found that FTH1 produced by myeloid cells in response to infection may be found in circulation and that it plays a key role in iron redistribution. Specifically, in the absence of FTH1 in myeloid cells, increased expression of ferroportin is observed in liver granulomas and increased iron accumulation occurs in hepatocytes.
